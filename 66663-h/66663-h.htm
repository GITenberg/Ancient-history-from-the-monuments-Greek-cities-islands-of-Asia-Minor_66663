<p class='c013'>Cyzicus—Lampsacus—Abydus—Assus—Palæ-Scepsis—Troy—Dr.
Schliemann—Ilium Novum—Alexandria—Troas—Pergamum or Pergamus—Æolis.</p>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Before</span> we proceed to give a somewhat detailed
account of the more important cities of Asia Minor,
and of the islands adjacent to its west and southern
shores, we may mention that Asia Minor, as it
lies on the map, exhibits, in its contour, a remarkable
resemblance to Spain. Extending between
N. Lat. 36° and 42°, and E. Long. 26° and 40°, it
is about the same size as France, and somewhat less
than Spain and Portugal taken together. Its interior
consists of a central plateau, rarely lower than
3,000 ft. above the sea, often much more; many
portions of it, however, especially to the N. and E.,
affording excellent pasturage for sheep, and, therefore,
now, as for centuries, the natural home of the
Turkomán shepherds.</p>
<p class='c015'>At the S.W. end of Asia Minor terminates, also,
the great central mountain-range of Asia itself, which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>running from the Brahmaputra westwards, connects
the Himálayas and the Caucasus.</p>

<p class='c015'>Many of the streams flowing from these mountains
are heavily charged with lime; hence the remarkable
deposits of travertine, &amp;c., to be seen at Hierapolis
and elsewhere. Indeed, to the geological
features of the country we owe the fact that the
military and commercial routes through Asia Minor
have been always nearly the same, the earliest and
the latest conquerors having followed the same roads.</p>

<p class='c015'>The present produce of Asia Minor is almost insignificant
when considered with reference to its geographical
area, and to the great wealth extracted from
it by the Romans (Cic. pro Leg. Manil. 2). But every
land, alike, decays under the oppressive and unintelligent
rule of the Osmanlis of Constantinople. The
name, Asia Minor, we may add, is comparatively
modern, and is not met with earlier than Orosius,
in the fifth century A.D., while that of Anatolia
(Ἀνατολἠ) is used first by Constantinus Porphyrogenitus,
in the tenth century A.D.</p>

<p class='c015'>The chief provinces of Asia Minor (omitting the
smaller subdivisions of Ionia, Æolis, and Troas, included,
as these latter are usually, under Mysia and
Lydia) are the following:—Mysia, Lydia, Caria, to
the W., and fronting the Ægean Sea; Lycia, Pamphylia,
and Cilicia, opposite to Crete and Cyprus;
Bithynia, Paphlagonia, and Pontus, on the Black
Sea; and, in the centre, Pisidia and Lycaonia, Phrygia,
Galatia and Cappadocia.</p>

<p class='c015'>We propose to notice the more important towns,
according to the order of the provinces just recited;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>and, following this order, we take first Mysia and
its chief town, <span class='sc'>Cyzicus</span> (the <i>Esquize</i> of mediæval
times), which was situated on the neck of a peninsula
running out into the Sea of Marmora. Mr. Hamilton
describes its position as “a sandy isthmus, having
near its southern end many large blocks of stone,”
not, improbably, the remains of Strabo’s “bridge.”
Many ancient monuments may still be traced among
its present cherry-orchards, attesting its original magnitude
and magnificence, most of the relics now
visible being Roman, and its destruction having, no
doubt, been mainly due to the great earthquakes in the
reign of Tiberius and Aurelius, which ruined and
depopulated so many other of the fairest towns of
Asia Minor.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tacitus, speaking of A.D. 17, the 4th of Tiberius, says:—“Eodem
anno duodecim celebres Asiæ urbes collapsæ nocturno
motu terræ” (Annal. ii. c. 47): and Cicero speaks of Cyzicus
as “urbem Asiæ celeberrimam nobisque amicissimam.” Compare
also Apoll. Rhod. i. 936-941, 983-987; Valer. Max. ii. 630;
Ovid. Trist. i. 9.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Hamilton, indeed, noting the loose and rubbly
character of its buildings, doubts the architectural
fame of the city; but it is probable that what we
now see was once cased with marble, as much fine
marble is found in the adjacent hills. Some, too, of
its buildings are of a granite easily disintegrable.
Any how, it would seem to be a place where well-conducted
excavations might bring to light many
curious relics of the past. Cyzicus was classed by
Anaximenes of Lampsacus among the colonies of
Miletus, but was not of importance till the close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of the Peloponnesian war, when, by the discreditable
peace of Antalcidas, it was surrendered to the
Persians, its ultimate prosperity being in great measure
due to its position, as a natural entrepôt, between the
Black Sea and the Ægean. In Roman times it was,
according to Strabo, a “Libera civitas,” and, with the
exception of Nicomedia and Nicæa, the most important
city in that part of Asia Minor. In the days
of Caracalla it had become a “Metropolis,” and,
still later, was an Episcopal see.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of the great wealth and, we may perhaps add, of
the popularity of its citizens in the fifth and fourth
century B.C., the gold coins, called Cyzicene <i>staters</i>,
are ample evidence; though it may be doubted
whether, as was once thought, the <i>zecchino</i> (or
sequin), means <i>Cyzicene</i>. In an able paper by Dr.
(now Sir Patrick) Colquhoun (Trans. Roy. Liter. vol.
iv. p. 35), it is clearly shown that the “<i>Squise</i>” of
Ville-Hardouin is the ancient Cyzicus, “the oldest
commercial place in the world,” as that writer, with
some exaggeration, asserts. The form “Esquisse” is
probably, as Dr. Colquhoun suggests, a corruption of
εἰς Κὐζικον (“to Cyzicus”).<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Dr. Colquhoun’s paper
is full of curious information on the early mediæval
state of this part of Asia Minor. Its decline was mainly
due to the invasion of the Goths in A.D. 262, but it long
remained the metropolis of the Hellespontine province
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>(Hierocl. Synecd. p. 661. Malala, Chron. i. p. 364).
It was finally destroyed by an earthquake in A.D. 943.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Similar modern modifications may be noticed in other sites
of the Levant. Thus, Stanchio (Kos) comes from εἰς τἡν Κῶν;
Stamboul is not, necessarily, a corruption of Constantinopolis,
but, more probably, of εἰς τἡν πόλιν (“to the city”); so Stalimene
(Lesbos) comes from εἰς τὁν λιμἐνα (“to the port”).</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Another Mysian town of note was <span class='sc'>Lampsacus</span>, also
a colony of Miletus and Phocæa, attested as this is by
its gold and silver coins, and by a statue of a prostrate
lion, said to have been the work of Lysippus, and subsequently,
placed by Agrippa in the Campus Martius
at Rome. The town was famous for its wine, and was,
for this reason, granted to Themistocles, who is said
to have learnt here, or at Magnesia, Persian in a year;
the district around having been granted to him by
his old enemy the King of Persia. Like most of the
towns of western Asia Minor, it often changed hands
during the rival contests of its more powerful neighbours;
but, having, with a wise forethought, voted a
crown of gold to the Romans, it was accepted by them
as an ally,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and, hence, was, in the time of Strabo,
a town of some magnitude. A small village, called
Lampsaki, most likely marks on our modern maps the
site of the old town.</p>

had favourably inclined the Romans to it (Liv. xxxiii. 38; xxxv.
42; Polyb. xxi. 10).</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>A little to the south of Lampsacus was <span class='sc'>Abydus</span>,
at the narrowest part of the Hellespont, and opposite
the town of Sestus.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a> It was a little above
Abydus that Xerxes constructed his famous bridge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>B.C. 480; but, except for the gallant resistance it
made to Philip, son of Demetrius, king of Macedon,
Abydus has no place in history. In legendary
lore, however, it was the scene of the famous swimming
of Leander to visit his lady-love, the Priestess
of the Temple at Sestus, on the opposite or European
shore, a natatory feat, however, far surpassed in
recent days. Lord Byron’s lines on the subject are
well known:—</p>

      <div class='line'>He could, perhaps, have pass’d the Hellespont,</div>
      <div class='line'>As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)</div>
      <div class='line'>Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.</div>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f4'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The average breadth of the Hellespont was about three
miles—rather narrow for Homer’s πλατὑς, “the broad.” He,
probably, however, looked on it rather as a mighty river; to
which, indeed, his epithets of ἀγάῤῥοος and ἀπείρων (“strong-flowing,”
and “boundless”) well enough apply. Herodotus
calls it δολερὁς and ἀλμυρὁς ποταμός, “a treacherous and
unsavoury river” (vii. 35).</p>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c017'>Leander’s labour, however, was greater than that of
the poet or his companion, in that he swam <i>against</i>
the stream to reach Sestus, the current being often so
powerful that a well-manned boat cannot be pulled
straight across it.</p>
<p class='c015'>A little further down the coast, and facing nearly
due south, is <span class='sc'>Assus</span>, a site which has been visited
by many travellers, as Walpole, Choiseul-Gouffier,
Raoul-Rochette, Fellows, and Pullan. The most ancient
monuments of Greek art in the Louvre at Paris
were removed thence. The position of the chief buildings
is very grand; indeed, in Strabo’s time, Assus
was considered as a fortress almost inaccessible.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a> Its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>ruins are still remarkably perfect, one gate at least, of
triangular construction, resembling those at Mycenæ
and Arpinum. There are, also, vestiges of a hexastyle
Doric temple, showing some analogy with those
at Pæstum. Seventeen large fragments from the
metopes and two façades of the Temple were ultimately
removed to France by Capt. Chaigneau,
together with a Doric capital. They were found scattered
over the slope of the hill, and must have been
removed at some time or the other, probably for
building purposes; indeed, fragments of similar pieces
were also noticed in some of the neighbouring
houses. In character of workmanship, the sculptures
resemble the Æginetan marbles now at the
British Museum. But their execution is not so effective,
the material of which they are made being the
coarse red stone of the neighbourhood. To the same
cause is, perhaps, due the fact that they had not
been carried away long ago. Had they been of fine
marble, they would have been valuable plunder. Sir
Charles Fellows, speaking of Assus, says, “After
depositing my baggage, I took the most intelligent
Turk in the place as my cicerone....
Immediately around me were the ruins, extending
for miles, undisturbed by any living creature
except the goats and kids. On every side lay
columns, triglyphs and friezes, of beautiful sculpture,
every object speaking of the grandeur of this ancient
city. In one place I saw thirty Doric capitals placed
up in a line for a fence.” Sir Charles Fellows gives
a drawing of one of the friezes now in Paris, and
adds, “I then entered the Via Sacra, or Street of
Tombs, extending for miles. Some of these tombs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>still stand in their original beautiful forms, but most
have been opened, and the lids are lying near the
walls they covered, curiosity or avarice having been
satisfied by displacing them....
These ruins are on a considerably larger scale than
those of the Roman city, and many of the remains
are equally perfect. Several are highly ornamented
and have inscriptions; others are as large as a temple,
being twenty to thirty feet square; the usual height
of the sarcophagus is from ten to twelve feet.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The character of the position of Assus led to a joke of the
musician Stratonicus, who applied to it a line of Homer (Il. vii.
144), playing on the meaning of the word Ἆσσον, viz.</p>
<p class='c021'>Ἅσσον ἴθ’, ὡς κεν θᾶσσον ὀλέθρου πείραθ’ ἵκηαι,</p>
<p class='c017'>Come more quickly (or come to Assus), “that ye may the
more quickly come to utter destruction.” At Assus, St. Luke, and
other companions of St. Paul, rejoined him with their ship, the
Apostle having walked on foot from Alexandria Troas (Acts xx. 13).</p>

power of destroying the flesh of bodies buried in it (whence the
name <i>sarkophagus</i>, or “flesh-consuming,”) is noticed by Dioskorides
and Pliny. But this Greek word is rarely used for a tomb,
the more usual word being σορός (soros). By the Romans, however,
it was used, as in Juv. x. 170. Colonel Leake observes
of the ruins of Assos, “The whole gives, perhaps, the most
perfect idea of a Greek city that anywhere exists” (Asia Minor,
p. 128). See also R. P. Pullan, “Ruins of Asia Minor,” p. 19.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Palæ-Scepsis</span> is interesting for the native tradition,
that it was once the capital of Æneas’s dominions.
It appears to have been situated near the source of the
Æsepus—high up on Mount Ida—the later Scepsis
being about sixty stadia (7½ miles) lower down (Strabo,
xiii. 607). Dr. Colquhoun<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a> states that a village in the
neighbourhood still bears the name of <i>Eski Skisepje</i>,
which, as Eski means “old” in Turkish, corresponds
with Palæ-Scepsis; Dr. Colquhoun at the same time
quotes the words of its discoverer, the distinguished
Oriental scholar, Dr. Mordtmann. “I did discover,”
says Dr. Mordtmann, “a most ancient city with its
acropolis, towers and walls built of hewn stone, and
furnished with four gates. The antiquity of the place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>was manifested by an oak having fixed its roots in the
wall, and by its trunk having grown to a girth of 530
centimètres (about 17 feet). On reference to Strabo,
I first became aware that I had discovered, probably,
the most ancient ruin in Asia Minor, for I hold that
this can be no other than Palæ-Scepsis.” The evidence
adduced by Drs. Mordtmann and Colquhoun
confirms the accuracy of Strabo. The later town of
Scepsis is memorable for the discovery there, during
the time of Sylla, of the works of Aristotle and
Theophrastus, which had been buried by the illiterate
relations of one Neleus (a pupil of Aristotle and
friend of Theophrastus), lest they should be carried
off by Attalus, then founding his library at Pergamus.
It appears from Strabo, that though preserved
from utter ruin, the precious MSS. had suffered
much from damp and worms; but they suffered still
more by the injudicious efforts of their purchaser,
Apellicon of Teos, a well-meaning person, though
wholly incompetent to supply the gaps he found.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the most celebrated place in Mysia was the
ancient city of <span class='sc'>Troy</span>. It would be out of place
here, indeed impossible, to discuss any of the various
theories of ancient or modern times referring to this
famous town and its no less famous war. It is enough
to state here our firm belief in the existence of both,
and further, that the legends since grouped around
them by no means demand any such non-existence.
We have no doubt that a prominent conical hill, now
called Hissarlik, does represent the spot where old
Troy once stood.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a> The convergency of the various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>stories of ancient history, the existence at Hissarlik
of ruins of remote antiquity, and the singular fitness of
the position (unless, indeed, all that is attributed to
Homer is to be condemned as purely mythical), lead
to the seemingly inevitable conclusion that here, if
anywhere, once stood this celebrated town.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It has been, justly, we think, remarked (Quarterly Review,
April, 1874), that “not one of the sceptical critics has ever questioned
that these (the Homeric poems) show an acquaintance
with the topography of the region which (and this is no small
point) has borne, from all known antiquity, the name of the
Troad.... Homer’s Ida, and Scamander, and Hellespont are
as real in his pages as in their existence at the present day.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The inhabitants of Ilium were a mixed population,
partly, it is probable, of Thracian origin, and so far
only Greek that a Pelasgian element may be traced
in both peoples, while they were probably, also,
inferior in civilization to the Greeks, with barbaric
habits and manners, already obsolete among their
more polished enemies. Nor, again, is it at all
necessary to maintain that the capture of Troy
implies its entire destruction; it is, indeed, more
likely that its ultimate ruin was due to the enmity
of its Asiatic neighbours, as suggested by Strabo on
the authority of an ancient writer, Xanthus. It
is clear that Ilium stood on rising ground, between
the rivers Scamander and Simois, and that here were
placed the palaces of Priam and of his sons. The
whole spot was, we may reasonably conclude, surrounded
by strong walls, with many gates, only one
of which is, however, noticed in Homer by name.
Such was the tradition, the long endurance of which
is shown in the subsequent sacrifice by Xerxes, recorded
by Herodotus (vii. 43).</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The new Ilium of later days most likely occupied the
same traditional site; the theory of Demetrius of Scepsis,
adopted by Strabo, of two Iliums separated the one
from the other by a considerable interval of ground,
being clearly adverse to a common-sense view of
the question.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Any one would naturally expect that
those who constructed <i>Novum Ilium</i> would select that
place for their town to which the legends most distinctly
pointed; while a manifest objection to the view
of Demetrius is that it converts Homer from a poet
into a topographer, and attempts to make the natural
features of the country accord with his poetic descriptions.
It is far more probable that Homer, or whoever
collected the poems passing under his name,
had but a very general idea of the localities where
were laid the scenes he describes: while there is, also,
no general agreement as to the true site of Troy
among those writers who, in modern times, have
more or less accepted the theory of Demetrius and
Strabo. Indeed, on the idea of Homer having written
his poems with an Ordnance map in his lap, it is
simply impossible to fix on any one spot that satisfies
all the conditions of his story.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The site for ancient Ilium of recent years the most popular
is called <i>Bournarbashi</i>, where the Scamander emerges from the
lower ridges of Mount Ida, and, therefore, not far from the
“village of the Ilians.” This view, proposed originally by Chevallier
in 1788, and, subsequently, adopted by Rennell, Leake,
Welckher, Forchhammer, Choiseul-Gouffier, and others, has,
however, been completely answered by Grote, whose arguments
have been fully confirmed by the latest researches.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>We must now notice the recent marvellous researches
of Dr. Schliemann, for, though they have
done little towards the revelation of Homer’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Troy, they have demonstrated that, many feet below
very ancient and still existing walls, there have
once been enormous structures, the treasury, fortress,
and royal residence of some wealthy ruler of
remote antiquity. While, therefore, we do not
believe that Dr. Schliemann has found old Troy,
in the same sense that Layard discovered the palaces
of Sardanapalus, the Greek inscriptions he has unearthed
have assuredly proved the identity of the
modern Hissarlik with <i>Novum</i> Ilium. What, then, is
the history of Schliemann’s researches, and what has
he done that any other man might not have done with
as ample means at his command? Doubtless there are
other men who might have done as much as he, notably
Mr. Layard. As Dr. Schliemann was much influenced
by his early education at home, and as his career has
been a very extraordinary one, we feel sure our readers
would like to know something of the digger as well
of as what he has dug out. We purpose, therefore, to
give a brief sketch of his personal history, and then,
with equal brevity, to add a notice of what he has
accomplished.</p>

<p class='c015'>Born in 1822 at a small village in Mecklenburg, he
tells us that, “as soon as I learnt to speak my father
related to me the great deeds of the Homeric heroes,”
and, though from ten years of age he was an
apprentice in a warehouse,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a> he always retained, as he
adds, “the same love for the famous men of antiquity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>which I conceived for them in my first childhood.”
As time went on Schliemann became a clerk, though
on a yearly salary of only £32: but he contrived to
live on half—to do without a fire, and to devote all
his spare moments to the study of languages. Thus
he learnt first English and French, each in six months,
and then other modern tongues, including Russ.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this “warehouse,” let it not be forgotten, Schliemann
was employed from fourteen to twenty years of age, from 5 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>
to 11 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, selling herrings, butter, brandy, milk, &amp;c.; and that
it was not till after he had lost this occupation from an injury
caused by lifting a cask, that he was <i>promoted</i> to the clerkship
at the salary mentioned in the text.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>To Dutch, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese he
allowed only six weeks each. During the eight years
from 1846 to 1854 he was so much occupied in
business that he had no time for literature; in the
latter end, however, of the second year he found time
to learn Swedish and Polish. It was not till January,
1856, that he ventured to attack Greek, his fear being,
as he naïvely remarks, that the fascination of its study
might interfere with his commercial duties. Aided
however by two Greek friends, he tells us he learnt
modern Greek in six weeks, and, in three months
more, sufficient classical Greek to understand the
ancient writers, and especially Homer. In 1858 Dr.
Schliemann was able to travel over Sweden, Denmark,
Germany, Italy, and Egypt, on the way learning somewhat
of (we presume colloquial) Arabic, and returning
thence through Syria and Athens to St. Petersburg.
It was not, however, till 1863 that he had secured, by
his vigorous commercial occupations, the means to
spend the rest of his life as he pleased.</p>

<p class='c015'>His first plan, in 1864, was to visit the fatherland
of Ulysses, but this was only a hasty and flying trip,
and he was, shortly afterwards, induced to extend his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>journey to India, China, and Japan. On his return
to Europe he spent some time in Paris, but made
also, thence, journeys to Greece and the plains of
Troy, an account of which, written, it would seem,
about 1868, he has given in the first volume of his
recent work. This volume contains, <i>inter alia</i>, the
result of his studies among the “Cyclopean” works
in Argolis, a knowledge of great value to him when
he commenced his more important excavations. He
seems also, about this period, to have carefully examined
the Troad, and to have satisfied himself
that Hissarlik was the place at which to commence
his excavations. Having married a Greek lady, in
every sense a “help-meet” for the work he had set
himself to do, he went again to the Troad in the
spring of 1870, and, having secured an ample number
of labourers, continued his excavations there during
the greater part of the period between the autumn
of 1871 and the summer of 1873.</p>

<p class='c015'>It must not be supposed that this work was one
of ease or pleasant toil: he had not the patient
“Chaldeans” who did Layard’s behests, still less had
he Hormuzd Rassam to settle, as a native only can
settle, the ever-rising disputes between the Greek and
Mussulman “navvies.” Indeed, to secure one pavement
from destruction, he had to tell his workmen
that by this road “Christ had gone up to visit King
Priam”! The cost, too, was very heavy; for he had
often 150 men in his employment, and expended,
from his own resources, fully £8,000. Is it possible
to estimate too highly such exertions towards the
ascertainment of the reality or falsity of ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>story, and this, too, by the only thoroughly effectual
means, the excavation of sites of traditional importance?
Can we withhold our admiration for the
labourer, even though his enthusiasm may have led
him to believe all he found was Trojan, the golden
relics, especially, being those of King Priam? and,
after all, what matters the theory of the excavator, so
the work he does is well done? As well might we
quarrel with Mr. Parker’s labours in Rome, because
he has coupled with his most valuable excavations his
own, somewhat fanciful, belief in the personality of a
Romulus. Every honest excavation, such as those of
Dr. Schliemann and Mr. Parker, are so many landmarks
recovered from all-destroying time. We can
well afford to dispense with or to smile at the fancies
of the excavators, so only that a careful record be kept
of what the excavations have really revealed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dr. Schliemann’s account of his diggings, between
the autumn of 1871 and June 17, 1873, has been published
in the form of twenty-three letters or memoirs;
a mode of narrative the more pleasant that it places
the reader <i>au courant</i> with the daily ideas of the
discoverer, though, necessarily, causing some repetition
and not a few corrections. His Introduction,
however, gives a sufficient summary of what he accomplished.
With the text he has also provided an
atlas of 217 photographic plates of the plans and excavations
carried on throughout the whole plain of
Troy, together with representations of between three
and four thousand individual objects discovered.
These photographs—not, we regret to say, from the
originals, but from drawings of them—are wholly inadequate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>to give any satisfactory idea of the beauty
or character of the objects themselves.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dr. Schliemann having, as we have stated, made
up his mind<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a> that the rising ground now called
<i>Hissarlik</i> (or fortress) was the site of Old Troy, commenced
his diggings there, on a plateau about 80
feet above the level of the plain, with a steep descent
to the N.E. and N.W. Above this plateau is a portion
of ground 26 feet higher, about 925 feet long by 620
feet wide, which he assumed to be the Pergamum of
Homer, or citadel of Priam. If so, beneath and
around this Acropolis must have been the second as
well as the earlier city. Dr. Schliemann went to work
much as miners do when they are “prospecting,” only
on a larger scale: he took soundings of the plain till
he reached the virgin rock, at a depth never greater
than 16 feet, at first meeting only with walls of houses
and fragments of pottery of a Greek or even later
period. As he found nothing else up to the edge of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the Pergamum,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a> he concluded that the original Ilium
did not spread into the plain, and that its area was
accurately defined by the great wall he afterwards
found. In short, he concluded that the city had no
special Acropolis,<a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a> as feigned by Homer, and that any
enlargement of the old town was due to the <i>débris</i>
gradually thrown down or accumulated around the
base of the small central hill. He adds, rather
amusingly, “I venture to hope that the civilized
world will not only not be vexed that the town of
Priam has shown itself scarcely the twentieth part as
large as was to be expected from the statements of
the Iliad, but, on the contrary, that, with delight and
enthusiasm, it will accept the certainty that Ilium did
really exist.”</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dr. Schliemann has fully stated in the <i>Augsburg Gazette</i>,
Sept. 26, 1873, his reasons for accepting Hissarlik for Troy, and
for rejecting Bounarbashi and other sites; and his reasons, to <i>an
antiquary</i>, are weighty:—1. At Bounarbashi, nothing has been
found earlier than potsherds of the sixth century B.C. 2. Sir J.
Lubbock, in the so-called tomb of Hector, found nothing earlier
than the third century B.C. 3. Von Hahn found neither potsherds
nor bricks on the north side of the Balidagh, between the
Akropolis (of Gergi) and the springs of Bounarbashi. 4. The
sites examined by Clarke and Barker Webb, and that of Ulrichs,
presented no remains of man. 5. The “village of the Ilians”—κώμη Ἰλιέων
of Demetrius of Skepsis—gave forth nothing
earlier than potsherds of the first century B.C. On the other
hand, under Hissarlik, have been found all or most of the remains,
treasure included, which Dr. Schliemann has secured.</p>
</div>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This word Pergamum or Pergama, which occurs more than
once in Asia Minor, notably in the case of the great city of that
name, is probably only another form of the
πύργος, <i>burg</i> or <i>berg</i>,
which runs through so many languages of the Indo-European
family. Thus, Sanskr. <i>spurg</i>; Gr. πυργ, originally σφυργος
or φυργος. So the Gothic <i>bairg-ahei</i>, mountainous; <i>fairg-uni</i>,
mountain. Compare, also, with this, Berge in Thrace, and Perge
in Pamphylia. Possibly, the Celtic <i>briga</i> (<i>Brigantes</i>, the dwellers
in the hills) is connected with the same root. The Arabs have
now adopted the word (see Rénan).</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>There is nothing specially remarkable in the small
size of the “supposed” Troy. It was an ancient custom
to build the town round a central Acropolis where
possible. So was it with Athens and Mycenæ,
with Rome, Carthage and Mount Zion; the ordinary
dwellings of the population for centuries
being huts or small cottages, like the traditional
<i>Tugurium</i> of Romulus, buildings which would, naturally,
leave behind them no traces of their former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>existence. It has been well remarked, that Homer
cannot fairly be accused of having <i>invented</i> this
Pergamum, as the hill was a natural fact: and that
what he really did, was, to indulge his imagination
as to the magnificence of the town he grouped on it
or in the plain round it.</p>

<p class='c015'>The little hill of Hissarlik became, therefore, the
centre of Dr. Schliemann’s labours, the most productive
field of his excavations, and the site where he
laid open walls far more ancient than Greek Ilium,
with a perfect entrance-gateway and paved road
through it, together with many remains of houses,
and a marvellous collection of relics, some of great
intrinsic value. But the most unexpected discovery
was the <i>position</i> of the various remains, proving, as
this did, that, at least, four different sets of people
had occupied this site, and covered it with their own
buildings, in complete unconsciousness that there had
been elder races there before them, whose remains
were actually under them. The same fact has been
noticed, but on a small scale, elsewhere. Thus Roman
London lies some sixteen or seventeen feet under the
Mansion House or Bank of England; so, too, Layard
found successive traces on the mound of Nimrud of
Arab, Roman, and Parthian occupation. But such
traces are as nothing to what Dr. Schliemann’s works
revealed. It was clear that the natural hill of Hissarlik
had been, at first, somewhat levelled, being also, in
some places, made more secure by a retaining wall,
and that, above this, the successive ruins have been
heaped up in a solid mass from 46 to 52 feet above
the native rock. On this, lastly, <i>Novum Ilium</i> was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>built. Dr. Schliemann gives a section, whence it
appears that, commencing from the existing surface,
Greek Ilium occupies about six feet in depth; that
at 23 feet below this, Dr. Schliemann’s “Troy of
Homer” is reached; and that, under this “Troy,”
again, is a third stratum 29 feet thick, the whole human
accumulations. The most sceptical person on the
subject of “Troy divine” cannot question the accuracy
of Dr. Schliemann’s measurements, whatever he
may think of his theories. It is manifest that even the
stratum immediately under Ilium Novum is essentially
prehistoric. Of what date, then, are the still lower strata?
Indeed, calculations, on such a point, can as little be
relied on as those of Mr. Horner on the <i>alluvium</i> of
the Egyptian Delta. There are, however, some matters
connected with them that must be noticed from their
peculiarity. Thus the super-imposed layers testify
to periods of occupation rather than to those of
destruction; while the theory of distinct and well-defined
stone, bronze, and iron ages completely breaks
down, stone implements occurring in all the strata, and
even where bronze is abundant. Iron, on the other
hand, is almost wholly absent. Thus instruments of
stone and of copper occur with ornaments in gold,
silver, and even ivory, evidencing, as these do, advance
in civilization and, as the cause of this, some
interchange of commerce with other nations.</p>

<p class='c015'>Whatever else, therefore, may be thought of Dr.
Schliemann’s researches, it cannot be doubted but
that the excavations at Hissarlik form a new chapter
in the history of man, and as such [apart from any
supposed connection with Homer], are a sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>reward for his labour and expenditure of capital. It
would unquestionably have been better (but who shall
control honest enthusiasm?) had he been less ready
to invest every discovery he made with some Homeric
name; we could have been well free of such pretentious
identifications as the Tower of Ilium, the
Scæan gates, the Royal Palace, and King Priam’s
Treasure; just as, in a similar case, Mr. Parker’s
valuable contributions to the early history of Rome
are not improved by the revival of the legend of a
Romulus and Remus, and of the suckling of these
heroes by a she-wolf. Nothing, however, allowing
for these slight blemishes, can exceed the interest of
Dr. Schliemann’s narrative.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The excavations,” to quote his own words, “prove
that the second nation which built a town on this
hill, upon the <i>débris</i> of the first settlers (which is
from twenty to thirty feet thick), are the Trojans
of whom Homer sings.... The strata of this
Trojan <i>débris</i>, which, without exception, bears marks
of great heat, consists mainly of red ashes of wood,
and rise from five to ten feet above the great wall
of Ilion, the double Scæan gate, and the great surrounding
wall, the construction of which Homer
ascribes to Poseidon and Apollo, and they show that
the town was destroyed by a fearful conflagration.
How great this heat must have been is clear also
from the large slabs of stone of the road leading from
the double Scæan gate down to the plain; for when
a few months ago I laid this road open, all the slabs
appeared as much uninjured as if they had been put
down quite recently; but after they had been exposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>to the air for a few days the slabs of the upper part
of the road, to the extent of some 10 feet, which had
been exposed to the heat, began to crumble away, and
have now almost disappeared, while those of the lower
portion of the road, which had not been touched by
the fire, have remained uninjured, and seem to be indestructible.
A further proof of the terrible catastrophe
is furnished by a stratum of scoriæ of melted lead
and copper of a thickness of from ⅕ of an inch to
1⅕ inch, which extends nearly through the whole hill
at a depth of from 27 feet to 29 feet.”</p>

<p class='c015'>It was here that Dr. Schliemann found the
prodigious structure he has named the “Tower
of Ilion,” a building no less than 40 feet thick.
“This tower,” he adds, “after having been buried
for thirty-one centuries, and after, during thousands
of years, one nation after another had built its
houses and palaces high above its summit, has now
again been brought to light, and commands a view,
if not of the whole plain, at least of its northern parts,
and of the Hellespont.” A little way beyond this
tower is a remarkably perfect gateway, fitted for two
pairs of gates, one behind the other, the upper fastenings
of which still remain in the stone posts. These
Dr. Schliemann takes for the “Scæan gates” of
Homer. He then came to what he calls the “Palace
of Priam,” no doubt, a house of some kind, at a depth
of from 22 to 26 feet, resting upon the great tower,
and directly under the Temple of Minerva. Its
walls were built of small stones cemented with
earth, and would seem to belong to different epochs.
The walls vary in thickness from 4 feet to 1 foot 10
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>inches. All about, within as well as without, are
abundant signs of fire, which must have burnt with
prodigious fury. Dr. Schliemann speaks of many feet
in thickness of red and yellow wood ashes. Here, as
at Nineveh and at Carthage, the first destruction
seems to have been fire, the great extent of it, in each
case, having probably arisen from the wooden construction
of the upper portions of these houses. At Nineveh,
it has been reasonably supposed that only the foundations
of the walls were of stone or brick, the upper
part, like many Eastern houses at the present day, being
wholly of wood, which would readily catch fire, and
fill the rooms below with burning embers. In several
of the rooms of one of these houses Dr. Schliemann
found red jars from 7 to 8 feet high, and, to the east
of the house, what he assumes to have been a sacrificial
altar, a slab of granite 5 feet 4 inches long by
5 feet 5 inches broad. Such a conflagration, it is
likely, would be long remembered; and it has been
acutely asked whether, after all, there may not have
been an Asiatic Iliad handed down from mouth to
mouth, of which Homer may have availed himself, as
did the mediæval Minnesingers.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next and the greatest of Schliemann’s discoveries
was also one of his last: we give it in
his own words. “In the course of excavations
on the Trojan wall, and in the immediate neighbourhood
of Priam’s house, I lighted on a great
copper object of remarkable form, which attracted
my attention all the more, as I thought I saw gold
behind. Upon this copper object rested a thick crust
of red ashes and calcined ruins, on which again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>weighed a wall nearly 6 feet thick and 18 feet high,
built of great stones and earth, and which must have
belonged to the period next after the destruction of
Troy. In order to save this treasure from the greed
of my workmen, and to secure it for science, it was
necessary to use the very greatest haste, and so,
though it was not yet breakfast-time, I had “paidos,”
or resting-time, called out at once. While my workmen
were eating and resting I cut out the treasure
with a great knife, not without the greatest effort and
the most terrible risk of my life, for the great wall of
the fortress which I had to undermine, threatened
every moment to fall upon me. But the sight of so
many objects, of which each alone is of inestimable
worth to science, made me foolhardy, and I thought
of no danger. The carrying off, however, of the treasures
would have been impossible without the help of
my dear wife, who stood by ready to pack up the
objects in her shawl as I cut them out, and to take
them away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>We may add that the whole find lay together
in a quadrangular mass, retaining the shape of
the box in which it had been deposited, and that
hard by was a large key, presumably that which once
locked it. The treasure had, probably, been hastily
packed, an idea fully sustained by its miscellaneous
character. Indeed, the same thing seems to have
happened in the case of the bronze plates found by
Mr. Layard at Nineveh. The mass of precious metal
found is simply astonishing, one cup alone weighing
40 oz. of gold, while there were besides, innumerable
objects in bronze, silver and gold, spears and axes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and two-edged daggers, together with a large bronze
shield, with a central boss, and a rim raised as if
to receive the edges of ox-hides or other covering.
Fortunately, the gold vessels had resisted the action
of the fire; some of them having been cast, others
hammered; in some cases, too, soldering had been
used. One curious portion of the collection Dr. Schliemann
describes as follows:—“That this treasure was
packed,” says he, “in the greatest haste, is shown by
the contents of the great silver vase, in which I found,
quite at the bottom, two splendid golden diadems, a
fillet for the head, and four most gorgeous and artistic
pendants for ear-rings. On them lay fifty-six golden
ear-rings and 4,750 little golden rings, perforated
prisms and dice, together with golden buttons and
other precious things which belonged to other ornaments.
After these, came six golden bracelets, and,
quite at the top of all, in the silver vase, were two
small golden cups.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides these more precious objects, Dr. Schliemann
met with a quantity of what, for want of a
better name, may be called idols, consisting of flat
pieces of stone, marbles, and terra-cotta, [and, in one
instance, of the vertebra of some antediluvian animal,]
containing on one side “an attempt to model a face
whether human or owlish.” Such objects are not
rare. In the British Museum are many flat pieces
of burnt clay, with moulding on them, of the rudest
kind, not wholly unlike what Dr. Schliemann found.
Dr. Schliemann sees in these the original type of
the sacred owl of Minerva,—to say the least,—a very
bold guess. Indeed, but for the place where they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>were found, their remote antiquity might be doubted,
as they might be, after all, but degraded types of
a good period of art. Dr. Schliemann, however,
maintains that many of these strange owl-headed
objects of clay are representatives of Athene,—in fact,
the original type of the γλαυκῶπις θεὰ, the “goddess
with the bright or flashing eyes,” and, also, that
this epithet ought to be now translated the “owl-faced
goddess”! But though Dr. Schliemann may
urge in favour of his views that, as the worship of
Athene was of Oriental origin, there is no reason
why she should not have been represented as owl-faced,
just as we find an eagle-headed Nisroch, a
hawk-headed Ra, and a ram-headed Ammon, there is,
really, no evidence in favour of his theory. Mr. Newton
has embraced everything in his remark that “the
conception of the human form as an organic whole, a
conception we meet with in the very dawn of Greek
art, nowhere appears” in Dr. Schliemann’s collections,
the probability being that these objects are of an
antiquity long antecedent to anything Greek, and the
work of a people in no way connected with the Greeks.
In Greek art, the usual adjunct to most representations
of Athene on coins is the owl, while in
Homer (Odyss. iii. 372) Athene leaves Nestor, under
the form of an osprey. It is possible, therefore,
that these metamorphoses symbolize a still earlier
faith.</p>

<p class='c015'>Having already stated our belief that not only did
an Ilium or a Troy really exist, but, also, that there
was a real living Homer, we need not notice the
objections urged against the opinions of Dr. Schliemann,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>on the ground that “as the Iliad is a mythical
poem, it is absurd to expect in it any historical kernel,”
a method of reasoning, to say the least, unsatisfactory,
if not fallacious. There is no conceivable reason why
the most mythical poem may not comprehend contorted
images of real events; the difficulty, in each
case, and the only real difficulty, being the unravelling of
the confused stories, which prevent our taking up the
tangled skein of history. No one supposes the early
legends of the Zendavesta to be history, yet some of
the stations of the migration from N.E. to S.W. can be
reasonably identified: so, too, no one supposes the
story of Gyges in Herodotus historical, though the
annals of Assur-bani-pal prove the reality of a “Gugu,
king of Ludim.” The prehistoric theory may be
pressed too far.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of the character of the art of the objects of
Dr. Schliemann, or of the date of his wonderful collections,
there is, at present, no evidence on which
to base a reasonable judgment. One thing, however,
seems certain; that they are not Greek—nor in
any way connected with Greek art. If among the
vast numbers of objects found, there may be some
objects resembling others met with in Greece, the
natural inference would be that, as so much of Greek
art is traceable ultimately to Asia, so, too, are
these. Nor must we, altogether, ignore the possible
effects of commerce. Dr. Schliemann has certainly
proved the existence of a wealthy population—living
on the spot that tradition and history alike
have assigned to Troy; and we cannot doubt that
the owners of these remains were pre-Hellenic. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>not so long ago that Semiramis was as mythical a name
as King Priam; and who can say that a future
Rawlinson may not prove the truth of a Trojan Priam
as clearly as that “Sammuramit” reigned in Nineveh?
The dwellers on the rock of Ilion clearly were “no
prehistoric savages,” but denizens of a real city, with
its fortress and palace. It is curious that, above
Dr. Schliemann’s “Trojans,” at a distance of from
23 to 33 feet, dwelt a population who constructed
their houses of small stones and earth,
and, occasionally, of sun-dried bricks. The artistic
remains of this people are inferior to those below
them; yet they made coarse pottery, battle-axes,
knives, nails, &amp;c., with a slight use of copper or
bronze, but with plenty of stone implements. This
place, having been destroyed in its turn, another set
of people occupied the mound, a race inferior in
civilization to all who had preceded them. These
people, it has been suspected, were Cimmerians,
perhaps, portions of the Nomad tribes, who, we know
from Herodotus and Strabo, constantly made eruptions
into Asia Minor.</p>

<p class='c015'>We must add that, among the various objects found
by Dr. Schliemann, were some scratches of the rudest
kind, on a honestone, from the first supposed to be
letters of some alphabet. The truth of this conjecture
has been recently proved by the persevering study
of Professor Gomperz, of Vienna, who says that, in
the comparisons he has made between the Cypriote
alphabet and the Hissarlik inscriptions, “I have not
schematized, I have not enlarged or reduced anything.
Every dot, every twist is copied with slavish accuracy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>from the best Cyprian documents. Nor have I
allowed myself to be eclectic and to mix letters of
different periods and localities.” Professor Max
Müller adds, “Accepting these statements of Professor
Gomperz, I can only repeat my conviction, that his
decipherment of the first inscription <i>Tagoi Dioi</i> seems
to me almost beyond reasonable doubt.” The interpretation
of the other presumed inscriptions is more
open to doubt.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is a remarkable fact, as clearly shown by Dr.
Schliemann’s researches, that the occupiers of all
these strata, alike, were tillers of the ground, while
the huge jars found standing upright can hardly have
been used for any other purpose than the storing of
wine, oil, or corn. The quantity of copper found
suggests a connection with Cyprus—the island of
copper—as do, also, the inscriptions just noticed;
subsequent analysis, however, has thrown doubt on
Dr. Schliemann’s idea that his vessels were of pure
copper.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a> The fine red pottery, too, is said to resemble
very much the existing pottery of Cyprus. The vases
are, however, not painted, nor have any traces of
sculpture been as yet detected.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Romans called their copper from Cyprus, <i>Cyprium</i>:
but the name of the island is, more likely, from the Hebrew
<i>Chopher</i>, the cypress tree.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>In concluding these notes on Dr. Schliemann’s
collection, which, from our limited space, have been
more condensed than we could have wished, we need
only add that, besides the greater and richer monuments,
Dr. Schliemann has found thousands of terra-cotta
disks or wheels, each with a hole in the middle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the purport of which has considerably exercised the
imaginations of the learned. Thus they have been
called spindles, weights for sinking nets or weaving
and <i>ex voto</i> tablets by Dr. Schliemann himself, &amp;c. The
variety of patterns on them is so great that, if anything
but meaningless ornaments, it is impossible to
suppose them all for one and the same purpose; and
the patterns on some of them are unquestionably
very curious. Thus we have scratches much resembling
the earliest Chinese sacred characters; others,
clearly astronomical; and, above all, that commonest
of Buddhist symbols, the <i>Swastika</i>, a cross with arms
curved or straight, and bent at right angles.</p>

<p class='c015'>With regard to <span class='sc'>Ilium Novum</span>, or Hissarlik, which,
as we have said, we believe occupies the site of the
older city, we must say, that whatever doubts may
have existed as to this point previously to Dr. Schliemann’s
excavations ought now to cease, as the Greek
remains he has found there are unquestionably sufficient
for this identification. How early Novum
Ilium was founded cannot now be determined; but,
as the place was one of some strength, it is reasonable
to suppose it may have been occupied very soon
after the fall of Old Troy, supposing, what, however,
is not necessary, that Troy was wholly destroyed.
When Xerxes passed, it was a place of importance,
and the son of Xerxes recognized it as a Greek city.
Alexander, too, like Xerxes, sacrificed there, and
bestowed many favours on the population, notably as
occupants of the presumed site of the ancient city;
the Romans did the same, perhaps with the additional
idea of protecting the traditional site whence they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>claimed their own descent (Liv. xxxvii. 37, xxxviii.
39). Sylla and Lucullus were, alike, friendly to it
and Lucan asserts that, after Pharsalia, Julius Cæsar
(mindful of his presumed ancestor Iulus) examined
for himself these localities (cf. App. Bell. Mithr. c. 53;
Plut. Vit. Syll.; Strab. xiii. 594; Lucan, ix. 967), at
the same time instituting the “Ludi Trojani,” noticed
by Virgil and other writers (Æn. v. 602; Suet. Cæs.
39; Dio Cass. xliii. 23).<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The famous <i>Sigean</i> inscription (now in the British Museum),
was procured by Lord Elgin from the porch of the village church
on the promontory of Sigeum, a little way S. of Hissarlik. For
many years it was supposed to be the oldest of Greek inscriptions;
but it is probably not so old as some of those from Branchidæ
procured by Mr. Newton, or, as the Greek inscription on the
Colossus of Psammetichus at Abu-Simbel, in Nubia. Its object
was to record the presentation of certain vessels for the use of
the Prytaneium at Sigeum by Phanodicus and Hermocrates, a
native of Proconnesus.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Alexandria Troas</span> (in the Acts of the Apostles
simply Troas) has nothing really to do with the
Trojan legend, but was an important place of commerce
in Roman times, and the capital of the surrounding
district. It was originally founded by
Antigonus,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a> and is chiefly memorable for the remarkable
munificence of a private individual, Herodes
Atticus, who built an immense aqueduct, some traces
of which still remain. Suetonius asserts that Julius
Cæsar once thought of transferring Alexandria in
Egypt to this place, and Zosimus adds that Constantine
had, also, at one time designed it as the capital of
his Eastern Empire (Suet. Cæs. c. 79; Zosimus, ii. 30);
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>an idea, perhaps, preserved in its present name <i>Eski
Stamboul</i>. It was thence that St. Paul and St. Luke set
sail for Macedonia (Acts xvi. 11), and here, somewhat
later, the Apostle restored the boy Eutychus to life
(Acts xx. 9). Lastly, on rounding Cape Lectum, we
come upon a deep and beautiful gulf, where stood the
ancient town of <i>Adramyttium</i>, according to Strabo, a
colony of the Athenians (xiii. 6), but, more probably,
the creation of Adramys, the brother of Crœsus. It
was early a place of considerable commerce, for which
its admirable position well fitted it (Herod. vii. 42).
Subsequently it was given by the Romans to the kings
of Pergamus, but was almost obliterated by Mithradates
(Strabo, xiii. p. 614). It was in a ship of Adramyttium
that St. Paul commenced his voyage from
Cæsarea to Italy to plead his cause before Nero
(Acts xxvii. 2).</p>

<p class='c015'>We come now to a city, <span class='sc'>Pergamum</span> or <span class='sc'>Pergamus</span>
(for the name is used indifferently, though the latter or
masculine form is, perhaps, the most common), which,
regard being had to the fact, that, as a great town, it
was not of remote antiquity, became in later days
one of the most celebrated places of antiquity. It
is said to have been a colony of the Heraclidæ
from Arcadia (Pausan. i. 4, 5), and to have been first
mentioned as a distinct city by Xenophon (Anab. vii.
8, 4), grouped, in all probability, round a fortress of
considerable natural strength, whence, indeed, it
derived its name. The commencement of its greatness
was its selection by Lysimachus as his treasure
city. Lysimachus was succeeded by Philetærus, and
subsequently by Eumenes, Attalus Philetærus II.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>&amp;c., a family remarkable for its noble deeds, as well
as for the proverbial wealth of many of its members.
Thus Attalus I., who was proclaimed King of Pergamus
for his glorious victory over the Gaulish
invaders, was eminent alike for his military skill, and
for his political foresight (Polyb. xviii. 29; Liv.
xxxiii. 21) in espousing the cause of the Romans.
Eumenes II., no less than his father, the firm friend
of the Romans, is worthy of record for the great
library he formed at his capital city, held in antiquity
to be second only to that of Alexandria (Strab. xiii.
p. 264; Athen. i. 3).<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c016'><sup>[16]</sup></a> It is said that in this library
skins were first used for writing on, and that, from the
title given to these sheets—“Pergamenæ chartæ”—we
derive the name of “Parchment” (Varr. ap.
Plin. xiii. 11).<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a> The last of the Attali, after a reign
of five years, dying childless, left his kingdom by his
will to the Romans (Strab. xiii. 624, xiv. 646).
Mr. Arundell gives a picturesque account of his ascent
to the citadel, and of the magnificent view thence.</p>

<p class='c015'>Immediately following on <i>Mysia</i> to the S. is the
great province of <i>Lydia</i>, the portion of it fronting the
Ægean bearing generally the name of <i>Ionia</i>, with a
small district at its N.W. corner, touching Mysia,
named <i>Æolis</i>. It was a popular belief that the
Æolians were the first great body of Greek colonists
to settle in Asia Minor, but, curiously, the name of
Æolians does not occur in Homer. Strabo makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>their advent to Asia Minor four generations earlier
than the Ionian migration, and this movement has
been supposed to have been contemporary with the
return of the Heracleidæ, and may, not improbably,
have been, in some degree, caused by it. In common
with the other Greek colonies, the Æolians
became subject to Crœsus, and, on the success of
Cyrus, were annexed to the Persian empire; hence,
in the Græco-Persian war, they contributed sixty
ships to the armament of Xerxes. The principal
towns of Æolis were Myrina, Cyme, Neontichos,
and Methymna. They are not, however, of sufficient
importance to detain us here. Pass we, therefore, to
<i>Ionia</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Phocæa</span>—the most northern of the Ionian cities—founded
by emigrants from <i>Phocis</i>, under two Athenian
chiefs, soon, from the excellence of its harbour,
secured a prominent place among the early maritime
states of the world, and was the first to establish
colonies on the Adriatic, the coasts of Etruria, Gaul,
and Spain. It is reported that Arganthonius, then
king of Tartessus (probably Tarshish), did all he
could to persuade these enterprising strangers to stay
in his land; and that, failing this, he gave them
large sums of money to build (or rebuild) the walls of
their native town. Phocæa is often mentioned subsequently,
though it does not appear to have performed
any very memorable actions. It may be traced
by its coins, and by the annalists and ecclesiastical
writers to the latest period of the Byzantine empire.
Indeed, so late as A.D. 1421, the Genoese built a
new town near its ancient site, which still retains the
name of <i>Palaio-Phoggia</i>.</p>
<p class='c015'>A little further to the S. we come to <span class='sc'>Smyrna</span>, one
of the most celebrated cities of Asia Minor, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>it was comparatively late in attaining this eminence.
It was situated on a bay of unrivalled beauty and
commercial excellence; and, almost alone of the
great cities or ports of Western Asia has preserved its
eminence to the present day, being now, as it has
long been, the chief emporium of the Levant trade.
In remote times, Smyrna successfully resisted the
attacks of Gyges, king of Lydia, and was, in consequence,
taken and destroyed by his successor,
Alyattes. It is said, that, after this blow, it was nearly
deserted for 400 years, but was, at length, rebuilt by
Antigonus and Lysimachus, though not exactly on the
same site. With this rebuilding its great prosperity
commenced. Nor were the claims to distinction
advanced by itself inferior to its real greatness.
Inscriptions abound (some of the best, indeed, among
the marbles at Oxford), where, as on its coins, it calls
itself ΠΡΩΤΗ ΑCΙΑC, the “first city of Asia”; and
so, indeed, it long continued, though at times suffering
severely from civil wars and earthquakes, and most
of all from the merciless treatment of Tímúr. Smyrna
claimed, especially, to be the birthplace of Homer, and
dedicated a temple to him. A cave was also shown
there, in which the poet was said to have composed
his verses (Pausan. Ach. 5). Smyrna is not, however,
mentioned by Homer. In the reign of Tiberius,
Smyrna contended with ten other cities for the
honour (?) of erecting a temple to that worthless
ruler, and won the prize; and here, not many years
later, the Christian Church flourished under Polycarp,
its first bishop, who is believed to have suffered
martyrdom in its stadium about A.D. 166.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Next to Smyrna we may take <span class='sc'>Clazomenæ</span>, a town
whose date is probably not earlier than the Ionic migration.
It was famous as the birthplace of Anaxagoras,
the philosopher, whose disciple Archelaus taught
Socrates and Euripides; and, also, as one of the states
which joined with the Phocæans in founding the
naval colony of Naucratis in Egypt (Herod. ii. 178).
It retained its name and existence till late in the
Byzantine period (Plin. v. 31; Ptol.; Hierocl. Synecd.),
but, towards the middle of the eleventh century, was
finally destroyed by the Turks.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Erythræ</span>, celebrated as the home of one if not
of two Sibyls—and a town whose life is traceable
by coins and inscriptions to a late period of the
Roman empire, and, from the acts of Councils and
other ecclesiastical documents, was manifestly for some
time an episcopal see. Its land produced good wine
[being called in a distich preserved by Athenæus
φερεστάφυλος Ἐρύθρα (Erythra yielding bunches of
grapes)],<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a> and fine wheaten flour:—<span class='sc'>Teos</span> (now Sighajik),
the birthplace of Anacreon and of Hecatæus
the historian; famous, too, for its temple, dedicated
to Bacchus, some remains of which have been published
by the Society of Dilettanti, and, recently, more
fully examined by Mr. Pullan:—<span class='sc'>Colophon</span>, an early
Ionian settlement, once the possessor of a flourishing
navy, and of cavalry reputed victorious wherever employed;<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
and illustrious for its poets, Mimnermus, Phœnix,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>and Hermesianax, and, possibly even Homer; till
at length it was destroyed by Lysimachus:—<span class='sc'>Priene</span>,
the birthplace of the philosopher and statesman Bias,
and still identifiable by considerable ruins near the
Turkish village of Samsoun, to the S. of Mycale,
with a famous Temple of Minerva Polias, the ruins
of which have been engraved in the “Ionian Antiquities.”
In Chandler’s time, about 100 years ago,
the whole circuit of the city walls was still standing.</p>

ἐπέθηκεν “he has brought the work to a completion.” And,

</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>But of the cities of W. Asia, no one took a higher
place than <span class='sc'>Ephesus</span>; though not one of the most
ancient, or noticed by Homer. Pliny ascribes its
origin to the Amazons; and Strabo gives an excellent
account of its site, the chief feature of which was a
celebrated port called Panormus, with the temple of
Diana, one of the Seven Wonders of the world, at a
little distance without the city walls. The worship of
this Diana (of Asiatic origin, and symbolized by her
peculiar statue) was earlier than the planting of the
Ionian colony by Androcles, as has been reasonably
suspected, on a hill called Coressus, the lower ground
(ultimately the chief part of the city) having been
only gradually built over. After its first colonization
we hear nothing of Ephesus till the time of Crœsus,
who is said to have failed to take the town, owing to
a device of a certain Pindarus, who attached the city
to the temple by a rope, thus making the intervening
space sacred, or an asylum. On this the story goes,
that Crœsus, of all princes then ruling, a lover of the
gods, spared, indeed, the city, but showed his common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>sense by changing its constitution and banishing
Pindarus. It further appears that Crœsus dedicated
golden bulls at Ephesus, and helped largely in the
construction of the first temple dedicated there. The
temple we now know was about 1,400 yards from the
city, a fact, apparently, not anticipated by the first
modern investigators of its site.</p>

<p class='c015'>The inhabitants of Ephesus, as a rule, were time-servers,
and ready to court the support of whosoever
for the time being were their most powerful neighbours.
Thus, at first, they joined the Ionian revolt;
then, on the overthrow of Xerxes, were for a while
tributary to Athens; and then, again, after the victories
of Lysander, permitted their city to be the
head-quarters of the Spartan operations against Asia
Minor; though he could not, however, persuade the
people to change the name of their city to that of
his wife Arsinoe. After the overthrow of Antiochus,
Ephesus was added by the Romans to the kingdom
of Pergamus.</p>

<p class='c015'>Again, when Mithradates was all-powerful, we find
the people of Ephesus, to please him, joining in a
general massacre of the Romans in their town; indeed,
going to such lengths as not to respect the
asylum of their own temple; the natural result being
a severe punishment of this fickle population on
the ultimate success of the Romans. On an inscription,
however, recently discovered, we believe,
by Mr. Wood, but now at Oxford, the people
assert that they had been compelled to act against
their will, and that they were none the less, at
heart, the devoted friends of the Romans. As a
place of commercial importance, Ephesus did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>survive the first three centuries of the Roman empire,
as the city was sacked by the Goths in A.D.
262, and its famous temple burnt, an event of which
some traces have been detected during the recent
excavations on its site. In later days it passed into
the hands of the Seljuks and Turks, and a great
mosque was built there by Selim I. on the rising
ground overlooking the port. The long occupation
of the site of Ephesus by a mixed population is
attested by the discovery there by Mr. Wood of a
hoard of coins, belonging chiefly to the Western States
of Europe, and struck during the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries. Among these are some of the
Christian subjects of Saro-khan, an emir of Magnesia
in the fourteenth century.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a> It is believed that the
present name of its site, Aiosoluk, is a corruption
of Hagios Theologos (St. John), the name borne by
Ephesus during the Middle Ages.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r20'>20</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An interesting account of these coins (2,231 in number) has
been given in the Numism. Chron., vol. xii. New Ser., 1872,
by Mr. H. A. Grueber, of the British Museum. The whole
“find,” with some lumps of metal, weighed more than seventeen
pounds of silver. Among these were coins of Naples, of
Rhodes, of the Seljuk Amírs, of Venice, Genoa, and of the
Papal States, their dates embracing a period of about eighty
years, from A.D. 1285.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The chief glory of Ephesus was its temple. According
to the most ancient reports, there had been
in remote times one, at least, of the grandest proportions
which Herodotus claims, with that of Juno at
Samos, as among the greatest works of the Greeks.
Its architect is said to have been contemporary with
Theodorus and Rhœcus, the builders of the Samian
Heræum, early in the sixth century B.C.; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Xenophon, especially, notices it, as he deposited there
the share entrusted to him of the tenth, arising from
sale of the slaves of the Ten Thousand at Cerasus,
which was appropriated to Apollo and Artemis.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c016'><sup>[21]</sup></a> We
have here an instance of a custom noticed elsewhere,—viz.,
that the great temples of the Hellenic world
were often used as banks of deposit, where treasure
was collected, not merely in the form of <i>anathemata</i>
or dedicated objects, but, also, in large quantities of
bullion, &amp;c., <i>in trust</i>. Many inscriptions in Boeckh
show clearly that the administrators of the temples
employed these treasures as loans. Artemis was, in
fact, a queen, whose dower was the wealth accumulated
in her temple. As is well known, the original (or the
second temple of Artemis, for this point is not clear)
was burnt by Herostratus, in B.C. 356, traditionally,
on the same night on which Alexander the Great was
born, but it was soon rebuilt. It would take a whole
book, says Pliny, to describe all its details, and it is
admitted to have been the largest temple of antiquity.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r21'>21</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In Pausanias, vii. 11, will be found a very full and interesting
account of the worship of the Ephesian Artemis, but it is too
long to quote here. Pindar says, the worship was instituted by
the Amazons, Crêsos or Korêsos, an autochthon, and Ephesus,
the son of the river god Cayster, being the first builders of the
temple. For details of the older temples, see Strab. xiv. 641;
Xen. Anab. v. 3; Plin. xvi. 79; and Vitruv. x. 6.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Among other valuables, the temple contained the
famous picture by Apelles of Alexander, while the
circuit round it was an asylum where debtors and
worse rogues could screen themselves from justice,
an evil which, as an inscription recently found there
shows, Augustus found it needful to restrain within reasonable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>limits. Ephesus, too, was the usual port where
the Roman proconsuls landed, on their way to their
several provinces. Thus, Cicero came to Ephesus
when going to his government in Cilicia. So, too,
Metellus Scipio put in there before Pharsalia, and
M. Antonius after Philippi. There, too, also, was
collected the fleet of Antony and Cleopatra before the
fatal day of Actium.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r22'>22</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Le Quien’s “Oriens Christianus” gives a list of seventy Christian
bishops of Ephesus from Timothy to A.D. 1721. A good
many of the later ones could only have been bishops in name.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>But the most interesting matter to us in connection
with Ephesus have been Mr. Wood’s excavations there,
with his discovery not only of many unexpected monuments
of the ancient town, but of undoubted relics
of the famous temple itself. Mr. Wood, as the constructing
engineer of the Smyrna and Aidin Railway,
had naturally become well acquainted with the neighbourhood
of Ephesus, and, hence, so early as 1863, had
made, at his own expense, some excavations, clearing
out thereby the Odeum, and ascertaining the true
position of the Magnesian and Coressian gates. In
these researches, he met with several valuable inscriptions,
one of them referring to a certain Roman,
Publius Vedius Antoninus, who was at the time the
γραμματεὺς—the Scribe or Town-clerk—of the city.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
By degrees the position of the Theatre, the scene
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of the tumult at the time of St. Paul’s visit,
was clearly made out; but where was the Temple?
In the prosecution of his excavations Mr. Wood had,
however, met with many decrees of the people of
Ephesus relating to the Temple,—one of them containing
much curious information about the ritual
used in the Temple-worship, with lists of the votive
offerings, to be carried on certain days in procession
“through the Magnesian Gate to the Great Theatre,
and thence back again through the Coressian Gate to
the Temple.” Among the list of statues are several of
Diana, probably, such as those which “Demetrius and
his craftsmen” manufactured in the days of St. Paul.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r23'>23</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Colonel Leake, in 1824, seems to have given the first sensible
suggestion as to where the temple ought to be sought for. The
Admiralty chart of 1836 (the foundation of the maps of Kiepert
1841-1846) and of Guhl (1843), afforded also the first accurate
survey of the Gulf of Scala Nova. In 1862, Mr. Falkener
suggested the head of the harbour to the west of the city as the
most likely site.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/ip043.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='c001'>DRUM OF PILLAR.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>At length, in April, 1869, Mr. Wood came upon some
massive walls, which were proved to have been those
of the courtyard in which the Temple had once stood,
by an inscription in Greek and Latin, stating that Augustus
had rebuilt them; and, finally, in 1870, a marble
pavement was lighted on, at the depth of nineteen feet
below the alluvial soil of the present plain, together with
drums of columns, quite six feet high, one base being still
attached to its plinth. The site of the Temple of Diana
had been reached, and its style was, at once, seen to
have been similar to that of the Temple of Athene
Polias at Priene, and of Apollo at Branchidæ. It is
scarcely possible to speak too highly of Mr. Wood’s
tact and sagacity. Thus, considering the accounts of
ancient authors too vague as guides for excavation, his
first diggings were essentially tentative, and with the
view of meeting with some illustrative inscriptions. In
the Great Theatre he was more likely to find them
than anywhere else, and here, indeed, he discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>six large stones, originally from the cella of the
Temple, and each bearing various decrees. Indeed,
by the most important of these, to which we have
already alluded, the real clue was afforded as to
its whereabouts. The of finding this inscription confirmed
Mr. Wood’s original idea of feeling his way
to the Temple from one of the city gates, the result
being the discovery of two roads,—one of them
leading round the mountain Prion or Pion, the other
towards the town of Magnesia. He wisely determined
to trace the one which showed the greatest
amount of wear or use, assuming that if either of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>them led to the Temple it would be the most used
one. In the one round Mount Prion he found four
distinct ruts, deeply cut in its pavement of huge blocks
of marble, while the other road was worn scarcely at
all. He then devoted all his energy, to use his own
words, “in exploring the road round Mount Pion,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a>
which eventually led to the Temple.”</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r24'>24</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The spelling of the name of this little eminence does not
seem to be quite certain. Pausanias and Pliny call it Pion;
Strabo, on the other hand, Prion. There was a mountain so
named in the island of Cos. Comp. <i>Priene</i>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>In this way, the peribolus, or courtyard wall of
the Temple, was soon reached, and, not long after,
as before stated, the drums of several of the columns
were exhumed, lying in a confused mass as they
had fallen, sixteen or seventeen centuries ago. The
largest and best preserved of these drums, of which
a sketch is given as the frontispiece for this volume,
was found on February 3rd, 1871; it is somewhat
more than 6 feet high and 18½ feet in circumference,
and weighs 11¼ tons. From the figures carved on
it, one of which represents Mercury, it may be fairly
presumed that it was one of the thirty-six “columnæ
cælatæ” recorded by Pliny. Mr. Wood states that
though this splendid building was not only destroyed
by earthquakes and the malice of man, all the stones,
moreover, having been carried away that could be
used for building purposes, enough still remained to
enable him to draw out on paper an accurate plan of
its original shape and <i>contour</i>. He adds that, in
the course of his excavations, he “discovered the remains
of three distinct temples, the last but two, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>last but one, and the last. The former must have
been that built 500 B.C., for which the solid foundations
described by Pliny and Vitruvius were laid....
Between 5 and 6 feet below the pavement and under
the foundations of the walls of the cella, I found
the layer of charcoal, 4 inches thick, described by
Pliny. This was laid between two layers of a composition
about 3 inches thick, similar to, and of the
consistency of, glazier’s putty.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In conclusion, we may add that Mr. Wood found
abundant instances of the use of colour, chiefly vermilion
and blue, and one specimen of gold inserted,
as a fillet; together with several pieces of friezes
much shattered, but, evidently, of the same size and
artistic character as the reliefs on the drum. The
reliefs themselves do not exhibit any great artistic
merit, though they fairly represent the characteristic style
of the Macedonian period: their general effect must,
however, have been very rich and gorgeous, and quite
in character with what we know of rich and luxurious
Ephesus. We have not, at present, any evidence that
the columns, as well as the drums, were covered
with sculpture. Mr. Wood, we believe, thinks they
were, but a medallion in the Bibliothèque at Paris,
which gives the front of the Temple, rather suggests
the contrary.</p>

<p class='c015'>Passing on from Ephesus we come to the scarcely
less celebrated city of <span class='sc'>Miletus</span>, the parent, according
to Pliny, of more than 80 colonies.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Situated at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>mouth and, on the left bank, of the Mæander, Miletus
more strictly belongs to Caria; but it was, also, one
of the most conspicuous members of the Ionian confederacy.
It is believed that it was originally founded
by a colony from Crete, under the leadership of
Sarpedon, the brother of Minos; an idea, in some
degree, confirmed by a notice in Homer (Il. ii.
867). Herodotus (ix. 97) only mentions Sarpedon’s
establishing himself in Lycia. The advantageous
position of the town, with a harbour capable of
holding a large fleet, naturally gave it, from the
earliest times, the lead in maritime affairs. Its
most important colonies were Abydus, Lampsacus,
and Parium on the Hellespont; Proconnesus and
Cyzicus on the Propontis; Sinope and Amisus on the
Euxine; with several more on the coast of Thrace
and Tauris, and on the Borysthenes. The period,
however, of Miletus’s chief power was comprised between
its Ionian colonization and its conquest by the
Persians in 494 B.C. After that period, it did not
maintain the same lead among the seaports of the
Asiatic Greeks; indeed, during the time of its
greatest fame, peace was practically unknown among
its people, who were constantly distracted by factions
aristocratic or democratic.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r25'>25</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rambach—De Mileto ejusque coloniis (Hal. Sax. 1790)—has
attempted, not without success, to identify the larger number
of them.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>As was natural, the kings of Lydia made many
attempts to possess themselves of Miletus. In the reign
of Alyattes, however, the Lydian and Milesian quarrel
was, for the time, made up, the Lydian king having
been supposed to have incurred the wrath of the gods,
as his troops had burnt a temple dedicated to
Minerva at Assessos. Some of the rulers of the town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>were men of historic note, especially Thrasybulus, the
friend of the Corinthian Periander. Somewhat later,
the Milesians made a treaty with Crœsus, and, what
was of more importance to them, secured its maintenance
by Cyrus; hence, their town was spared much
of the misery inflicted on the other Ionian states in
the first war with the Persians (Herod. i. 141, 143).
But if Miletus had been previously fortunate, this
good luck deserted her during the great Græco-Persian
war; nor could she indeed complain, as the
chief promoter of this rebellion was her “tyrannus”
Histiæus. As will be remembered, it was mainly
through Histiæus and his kinsman Aristagoras, that
Ionia revolted against the Persians; and, further,
that, to the instigations of the latter, was due the
needless burning of the great western capital of the
Persians, Sardes. An immediate attack on Miletus
by the Persian satraps was the natural reply to this
treachery; and the city was eventually taken by storm,
with all the horrors consequent thereon.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a> It may
be doubted, whether after this fall, Miletus ever
again recovered her former glory.</p>

1,000 drachmæ for putting on the stage a drama entitled
“The Capture of Miletus.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Subsequently, Miletus made many spasmodic efforts
to regain her freedom, but with little avail, though
it still existed till the decline of the Byzantine
empire—its Church being under the direction of
bishops who ranked as Metropolitans of Caria

<p class='c015'>In the neighbourhood of Miletus stood, at <span class='sc'>Branchidæ</span>
or Didyma, the famous temple of Apollo
Didymæus, the site, we feel pleased to say, of
one of Mr. Newton’s most valuable researches.
It was known in Greek history from the remotest
times, as the site of a shrine and of an oracle second
only in sanctity and importance to that of Delphi; as
the spot where Pharaoh Necho dedicated the armour
he had worn when he took the city of Cadytis
(Herod, ii. 159), and as a place which received
from Crœsus, before his war with Cyrus, golden
offerings equal in weight to those he gave to Delphi.
It was plundered and burnt by Darius I., and, a
second time, by Xerxes, its sacred family of priests
having been, on this occasion, swept off to Sogdiana
by the conqueror; but it revived again, in renewed
splendour, towards the close of the Peloponnesian
war, when rebuilt on a scale so vast that, according
to Strabo, it could not be roofed over: it was memorable,
especially, too, for a succession of oracles ascending
to a period before the commencement of
history, yet not wholly extinct even so late as the
days of Julian. It was reasonable to expect that such
a place would retain some relics of its past greatness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and of its pre-eminence among the sacred shrines of
antiquity. Indeed, many travellers, before Mr. Newton,
had spoken of the ruins of the Temple and of the
Sacred Way leading to it, and, from the notices in
Wheler (1685), Gell, Leake, the “Ionian Antiquities,”
and Hamilton, much valuable information may be
gathered.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was left to Mr. Newton to complete what had
been indeed, hardly done at all before, and to secure
for England the most important sculptures still <i>in situ</i>.
The Temple of Apollo Didymæus<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a> was originally approached
from the sea by a “<span class='sc'>Sacred Way</span>,” on each
side of which had once been a row of seated statues,
sepulchral <i>sori</i>, tombs, &amp;c. Along this “Way” Mr.
Newton discovered eight seated statues, generally
about 4 feet 6 inches high, by 2 feet 9 inches broad
and deep; the character of their workmanship being,
at the first glance, strikingly Egyptian, at least in this
respect, that their drapery, extending from the shoulders
to the feet, consists of one closely-fitting garment
(<i>chitōn</i>), and of a light shawl (<i>peplos</i>). One only
of the figures retains its head, the sculptured treatment
of it being that usually recognized as the most archaic
Greek, in that the hair is arranged in long parallel
tresses, as in the earliest coins of Syracuse. With
two exceptions, all these statues belong to the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>period of art. Mr. Newton says, it is evident that no
one of them occupied, when he discovered them,
exactly its original position, and that they must, at
some time or other, have been thrown down and partially
removed—an opinion confirmed by a somewhat
later discovery of about eighty feet of the original
paving of the “<span class='sc'>Sacred Way</span>,” together with some
bases, not improbably those on which these statues
had been originally placed. The “<span class='sc'>Sacred Way</span>” can
still be traced for about 580 yards.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r29'>29</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Didyma was the ancient name of the site where the temple
stood; hence the building was sometimes called the “Didymæum.”
Strabo speaks of it as τοῦ ἐν Διδύμοις ναοῦ. On the
pretence that the priests of Branchidæ voluntarily returned with
Xerxes to Persia, their descendants were cruelly murdered by
Alexander the Great (Strabo, xiv. 634, xi. 517; Quint. Curt.,
vii. 5).</p>

<p><span class='c001'>INSCRIPTION OF CHARES.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>In a wall extending along it are, here and there,
masses of polygonal masonry, with individual stones
of immense size, the remains, probably, of an
original Hellenic wall. At a short distance from
the last of the seated statues, Mr. Newton met
with two remarkable monuments—a colossal lion
and a female sphinx—both, unfortunately, much
injured. The sphinx was completely buried under
the earth, and had nothing in its form to recommend
it, but the lion had, on its side, a very ancient inscription,
which the barbarous Greeks of the neighbourhood
had done all they could to obliterate. The important
question is, to what period are these works to be
assigned? Now, of direct evidence we have none;
for, though history speaks of the two temples at this
spot, we have no record of the statues themselves;
the probability being that they were damaged nearly
as much as at present before Herodotus visited the
spot, and, probably, by the Persians. Yet, in spite
of the silence of history, we have some indirect evidence
from the monuments themselves; enough, at
least, to determine their age within tolerably accurate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>limits. In the first place, we have the character of
their art, which is, unquestionably, very archaic; secondly,
on three of the chairs are inscriptions in
the oldest Greek character; on the most important
one written <i>boustrophedon</i> (<i>i.e.</i> backwards and forwards,
as an ox ploughs); thirdly, a long inscription on
the recumbent lion, and another, quite as old, on a
detached block, the base, possibly, of a statue now
lost. In order that the nature of the characters used
may be comprehended, we annex a woodcut of the
legend on one of the chairs of the seated figures, the
translation of which is, “I am Chares, son of Clesis,
ruler of Teichaoessa, a [dedicatory] monument of
Apollo.”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c016'><sup>[30]</sup></a> On the block found near the chair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the inscription states that “the sons of Anaximander
have [dedicated a statue?] of Andromachus,” and
that “Terpsicles made it”: while that, on the side
of the lion,—the most curious of them all,—declares
that “the sons of Python, Archelaos, Thales, Pasikles,
Hegesander, and Lysias, have dedicated the
offerings, as a tenth, to Apollo.” Some years since, a
still more perfect seated figure was in existence, on
the chair of which was an inscription copied by Sir
W. Gell and Mr. Cockerell, and published by Boeckh
and Rose.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r30'>30</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This inscription was probably attached to a portrait statue.
Teichioessa, or Teichiousa, we know from Thucydides (viii. 26,
28), was a strong place near Miletus. Athenæus (viii. 351)
spells it Teichiûs. Mr. Newton suggests that Chares was
probably one of the petty rulers on the western coast of Asia
Minor in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., of whom Herodotus
notices more than one. A <i>bon-mot</i> of Stratonicus the musician
is recorded by Athenæus: “As Teichioessa was inhabited by
a mixed population, he observed that most of the tombs were
those of foreigners, on which he said to his lad, ‘Let us be
off, since strangers seem to die here, but not one of the
natives’” (viii. p. 351). Teichoessa was also famous for the
excellence of its mullets (Ital. <i>triglia</i>),</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r31'>31</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Colonel Leake (Journal of a Tour in Asia Minor, Lond.,
1824, p. 239) has given an account of this chair, and suggests
that the arrangement of these statues is similar to that of
the avenues of the temples in Egypt. In a note to p. 342
of Colonel Leake’s work, is a brief memoir by the late C. J.
Cockerell, in which he suggests that the temple at Branchidæ
was never completed, as the flutings of the columns are not
finished (see, also, pp. 347, 348). There is an engraving of this
chair in the “Ionian Antiquities.”</p>

<p class='c015'>We cannot discuss here the character of the inscriptions
quoted above, but all palæographers admit
that the writing belongs to the earliest Greek
period, not improbably anterior to the year B.C. 520.
It may be still earlier, as, on the lion inscription, we
find the name of Hegesander and another name,
which, though the first letter has met with an injury,
we agree with Mr. Newton in thinking, must be read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>as Thales, while, on the detached block, we have that
of Anaximander. Now it is certainly remarkable that
on two adjoining stones, found close to the most
sacred temple of the Milesians, the names of two of
the most celebrated philosophers of that town should
occur. If, then, these be really the names of those
philosophers, they may be supposed to have joined
with other citizens of Miletus in dedicating the figure
of the lion, and of the object (whether statue or
otherwise) once attached to the second inscription;
and, if so, the dates of these works would be between
B.C. 470 and B.C. 560. Anaximander was born about
B.C. 610, and Hegesander was probably the father
of Hecatæus, who was himself born about B.C. 520.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is worthy of remark that, unlike so many other
early Greek works, these sculptures exhibit no trace of
an Asiatic or Assyrian origin. The only style they recall
is that of Egypt, while the only Assyrian monument they
resemble is the semi-Egyptian seated figure brought
by Mr. Layard from Kalah Sherghat. Mr. Newton
has justly pointed out that the resemblance to Egyptian
work “is seen not only in the great breadth of the
shoulders, but also in the modelling of the limbs, in
which the forms of the bones and muscles are indicated
with far greater refinement and judgment than
at first sight seems to be the case ... the subdued
treatment of the anatomy contributes to the general
breadth and repose for which these figures are so
remarkable, and suggests the idea that they were
executed by artists who had studied in Egypt.” We
know that the Greeks were intimately connected
with Psammetichus I., Amasis, and Neco; while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>tombs at Cameirus, in Rhodes, have yielded works
almost certainly imitated from Egyptian prototypes
by early Greek artists. We have, too, the statement
of Diodorus, that Theodorus of Samos and his brother
Telecles of Ephesus, the sons of Rhoecus, derived the
canon of their sculptures from Egypt. The general
character, however, of the ornamentation, the mæander-pattern,
and the lotos and borders on the garments
of the seated figures, agreeing, as these do,
with the same patterns on early Greek vases, tend to
show that their actual artists were Greeks. Thus, too,
the archaic statue of Athene in the Acropolis at Athens
is essentially Greek, and not Egyptian. Pliny has
further noticed that two Cretan sculptors, Dipænos
and Scyllis, were the first artists (about B.C. 580) of
note, as workers in marble: it is, therefore, quite
conceivable that they may have been the actual artists
of these monuments.</p>

<p class='c015'>We shall now say a few words of <span class='sc'>Thyateira</span>, <span class='sc'>Magnesia
ad Sipylum</span>, <span class='sc'>Philadelphia</span>, and <span class='sc'>Tralles</span>
with some rather fuller remarks on the celebrated
city, <span class='sc'>Sardes</span>, the capital of Lydia.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Thyateira</span> was a place of considerable importance,
and probably of early origin, but of no great rank
among the surrounding towns till the time of the Macedonians;
its best known name, according to Steph.
Byzant., being due to Seleucus Nicator. To us, its chief
interest is its connection with early Christianity, as the
home of “Lydia the seller of purple” (Acts xvi. 14),
and as one of the Seven Churches of the Apocalypse.
There are still, according to Sir Charles Fellows, remains
of a considerable city; and it is also, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the name of Ak-Hissar, a flourishing commercial town.
Close to the Lake Gygæa, not far from Sardes, was the
sepulchral mound of Alyattes, considered by Herodotus
one of the wonders of Lydia. This remarkable tumulus,
which is about 280 yards in diameter, has been recently
excavated by M. Spiegenthal, who discovered in its
centre a sepulchral chamber of highly polished marble
blocks, and of about the same size as that of the tomb
of Cyrus. Such tumuli are common in Asia Minor;
indeed, round the same lake, are three or four more,
probably, as Strabo has suggested, the tombs of other
early Lydian kings. Sir Gardner Wilkinson has pointed
out that their structure—a stone basement with a mound
of earth above—resembles the constructed tombs of
Etruria.</p>

<p class='c015'>The <i>Lydian</i> <span class='sc'>Magnesia</span>—usually called “<i>Ad Sipylum</i>,”
to distinguish it from the Magnesia of Ionia—was
the scene of the great victory gained by the two
Scipios in B.C. 190, over Antiochus the Great though
aided by the Gauls, which handed over Western Asia
to the Romans. Hence, in the Mithradatic war, the
Magnesians stood firmly by Rome. A coin of this
place has on it the head of Cicero, and is interesting
as the only portrait (good or bad) we have of that
great orator. In legendary history, Mount Sipylus,
which overhangs Magnesia on the S., was famous as
the residence of Tantalus and Niobe; and here, too,
was a town of the same name as the mountain, said
to have been converted into a lake by volcanic
action<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a> (Paus.). Homer alludes to the mountain in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>speaking of Niobe’s transformation (Il. xxiv. 614), as
do also Sophocles (Antig. v. 822), and Ovid (Metam.
vi. 310). The story of the weeping Niobe was
probably an optical illusion (Paus. Attic. c. 21), and,
curiously, the origin of it has been clearly shown by
Chandler, who says, “The phantom of Niobe may
be defined as an effect of a certain portion of light
and shade on a part of Sipylus, perceivable at a particular
point of view. The traveller, who shall visit
Magnesia after this information, is requested to observe
carefully a steep and remarkable cliff, about a
mile from the town; varying his distance, while the
sun and shade, which come gradually on, pass over
it, I have reason to believe he will see Niobe”
(Travels, p. 331). The magnetic influence on the
compass is confirmed by Arundell, but the name
“Magnet” has been derived from other towns of the
same name.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r32'>32</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hamilton (vol. i. p. 49) confirms the identity of Sipylus
and its neighbourhood with the legend of Tantalus, by the
discovery of his friend Mr. Strickland (it had been previously,
however, noticed by Chishull) of a remarkable statue sculptured
on the rocky base of the mountain. “This statue” Mr. Strickland
states, “is rudely sculptured out of the solid rock. It represents
a sitting figure contained in a niche, and its height from
the base to the top of the head may be about twenty feet.”
“There can be little doubt that this is the ancient statue of
Cybele mentioned by Pausanias,” but it can scarcely be, as
some other travellers have supposed, Niobe.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Philadelphia</span>, named from Attalus Philadelphus,
suffered more than any other Lydian town from
earthquakes, so that, after that in the reign of Tiberius
it was well-nigh deserted. It continued, however,
to hold its own for many years, and is memorable
for the long and gallant resistance it made to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Turks. It submitted, at length, in A.D. 1390, to
Bayazíd, and is still a place of some size under its
new name of Allah-Shehr. Philadelphia is noticed
in the Revelations (iii. 7) as one of the Seven
Churches. A story long prevailed of a wall made of
bones of the citizens slain by Bayazíd; and Rycaut
remarks, that “these bones are so entire that I
brought a piece thereof with me from thence.”
Chandler, however, found a simple solution for this
wonder in a petrifying stream, like that at Laodicea.
“This,” says he, “encrusted some vegetable substances
which have perished, and left behind, as it
were, their moulds.” Gibbon particularly notices
the gallantry of the Philadelphians:—“At a distance,”
says he, “from the sea, forgotten by the
Emperor, encompassed on all sides by the Turks, her
valiant citizens defended their religion and freedom
above fourscore years, and, at length, capitulated
with the proudest of the Ottomans in 1390. Among
the Greek colonies and Churches of Asia, Philadelphia
is still erect, a column in a scene of ruins.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Tralles</span>, in the time of Strabo, was one of the most
flourishing cities of Asia Minor; indeed, situated as it
was, on the high road from Ephesus through Lydia
and Phrygia, it could hardly have failed to be a place
of great traffic (Cic. Ep. ad Att. v. 14; Artemid. ap.
Strab. xiv. p. 663). Hence its citizens were generally
selected to fill the expensive offices of Asiarchs,
or Presidents of the games celebrated in the province.
Though abundant ruins may be seen over the whole
site of the ancient city, they have been so shattered
by earthquakes as to be now scarcely recognizable.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>We come now to <span class='sc'>Sardes</span>, by far the most important
city of Lydia. The date of its foundation has not
been recorded, but it must have early been a place of
note, as Herodotus states that it was plundered by
the Cimmerians, though they could not capture its
citadel.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Its real importance, however, evidently began
when it became the capital of the Lydian monarchs,
men whose unusual wealth has been fully attested
by Herodotus, who had himself seen the gifts
of Crœsus in the treasury at Delphi. The story
of the mode whereby the citadel of Sardes was taken
by Cyrus is most likely true; indeed is, in some
degree, confirmed by a later capture, under circumstances
not unsimilar, by Lagoras, a general of
Antiochus the Great (Polyb. vii. 4-7).</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r33'>33</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sardes, from Σάρδεις; but it is often written Sardis.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Under the reign of Crœsus, Sardes was unquestionably
a great and flourishing city, the resort of men of
learning and ability, who were, Herodotus tells us,
attracted thither by the fame and hospitality of the
king (i. 29): on the success of Cyrus, it was simply
transferred from the native dynasty of rulers to the
conquering Persians, becoming thus, not only the
capital of Persian Asia Minor, but the occasional residence
of the monarch himself. Thus Xerxes spent the
winter there when preparing his unwise invasion of
Greece (Herod. vii. 32-37); and here, too, Cyrus the
Younger collected the army so easily crushed on the
fatal day of Cunaxa. Xenophon remarks that the
beauty of its gardens excited the admiration of even
the Spartan Lysander, who was amused by the tale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>that Cyrus himself had often played there the part of
gardener (Œcon. p. 880; cf. Cic. de Senect. c. 17).
The town itself seems to have consisted chiefly of
thatched houses, and so was easily burnt by the
Ionians in their revolt. The burning of Sardes was
felt by the Persian monarch to be a gross insult, the
more so that his rule had been notoriously mild and
equitable. Sardes made no resistance to Alexander
the Great; hence, its people were permitted by that
monarch to retain their ancient laws and customs
(Arrian, i. 17). During the wars of the Seleucidæ it
was, at different times, subject to the prevailing
ruler of that house, and, hence, passed over to the
Romans after the defeat of Antiochus at Magnesia.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
Colonel Leake has given, in his Asia Minor, some
interesting notes by Mr. Cockerell on the antiquities
of this town, with a special account of the famous
temple of Cybele, or the Earth, which stood on the
banks of the Pactolus, and of which three great
columns were then standing.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a> This temple was burnt
by the Ionians in B.C. 503, and never completely
reconstructed.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c016'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Most interesting to the Christian
are the remains of two churches, one supposed
to be that of the Church of the Panagia, and another,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>in front of it, said to be that of St. John. The
former is almost wholly constructed of magnificent
fragments of earlier edifices, and is, perhaps, as
Colonel Leake thought, “the only one of the Seven
churches of which there are any distinguishable
remains.” Bearing in mind, too, St. Paul’s residence
for three years in the neighbouring town of Ephesus,
we must suppose the capital of Lydia was included
in the declaration of St. Luke that “all they
which dwelt in Asia (<i>i.e.</i> Roman Proconsular Asia)
heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and
Greeks” (Acts xix. 10; compare also 1 Cor. xvi. 19,
and Rev. iii. 1-5). In later days, more than one
Council was held here. Indeed, this famous city may
be traced through a long period of Byzantine history
(Eunap. p. 154; Hierocl. p. 669). The emperor Julian
made Chrysanthius, of Sardes, pontiff of Lydia;
but his attempt to restore the heathen worship was
a failure. About A.D. 400 it was plundered by
the Goths under Tribigild and Cainas, officers in
Roman pay; in the eleventh century it was seized
by the Turks, and, two centuries later, nearly destroyed
by Tímúr. A miserable village, called Sart,
now occupies its site; and so completely has it passed
away, that we might inquire with Horace, “Quid
Crœsi regia Sardes?” if we may not quite add the
commencement of the following line, “Smyrna quid?”
(Horat. Epist. I. i. 2). No remains of its ancient
grandeur now exist, and the “princes” of Lydia,
her wise men, her captains, and “her rulers and her
mighty men” have long been asleep in the innumerable
tumuli spread over all the level country around.</p>

<p class='c015'>We proceed now to notice some of the more important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>towns of <span class='sc'>Caria</span>, and take first <span class='sc'>Halicarnassus</span>
(now Budrum) which had achieved the
most enduring fame, as the site of the Mausoleum
or Tomb of Mausolus, once of the Seven
Wonders of the World. Originally, a colony from
Trœzene, in Argolis, Halicarnassus had early adopted
Asiatic tastes and habits; hence, firmly adhering to
the Persians, its Queen Artemisia I., the widow of
Lygdamis, fought for Xerxes at Salamis. A remarkable
vase in Egyptian alabaster, with the name
and titles of Xerxes on it in the three forms of the
cuneiform writing, discovered by Mr. Newton in the
Mausoleum, was, perhaps, the reward-gift of the Persian
monarch for this service. To her namesake, the
second Artemisia, we owe the building of the Mausoleum,
130 years subsequently.</p>

<p class='c015'>With regard to the history of this remarkable
monument, it is well known that, on the death of
Mausolus, B.C. 353, Artemisia, his widow and sister,
resolved to celebrate his memory by all the honours
the art and literature of the period could bestow,
and to employ, for this purpose, four of the most celebrated
sculptors of antiquity,—Bryaxis, Timotheus,
Leochares or Scopas, and Praxiteles.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a> It is said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>that this queen’s short reign, of two years only, did
not enable her to witness the completion of her
grand design, but that these great sculptors finished
the work after her death for their own honour and
the glory of art. Much of what they accomplished
was, certainly, extant till comparatively modern times.
Thus, the building is noticed, first by Strabo and
Pliny, then by Gregory of Nazianzus in the fourth,
by Constantinus Porphyrogenitus in the tenth, and
by Eudocia in the eleventh centuries respectively;
all these accounts implying that it was still visible.
Again, Frontanus, the historian of the siege of Rhodes,
states that a German knight, Henry von Schlegelholt,
constructed the citadel at Budrum out of the Mausoleum.
Yet, even then, it was only partially destroyed,
for when Cepio visited Budrum in 1472 he mentions
seeing its remains among the ruins of the ancient
town. In the later repairs, however, of the citadel, the
masonry of the substructure of the Mausoleum must
have been wholly removed; the result being that
visitors to Budrum, before Mr. Newton commenced
his excavations, could not determine its site.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f37'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r37'>37</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Its architects were Satyrus and Phiteus, and the building
itself a parallelogram surrounded by thirty-six columns, supporting
a pyramid of twenty-four steps, which tapered to the top
like a <i>meta</i>, or goal. Its height was 140 feet. Martial describes
it as “Aere vacuo pendentia Mausolea.” Pausanias
states that the Romans admired it so much that they called all
similar buildings “Mausolea”; while Eustathius, in the
twelfth century, observes of it, Θαῦμα καὶ ἦν καὶ ἔστι (“it
was and is a wonder”) clearly implying its existence, in some
form or other, even then. In M. Guichard’s “Funérailles de
Romains,” &amp;c., Lyons, 1581, the sculptured reliefs and “certain
white marble steps” (possibly those of the pyramid) are
noticed. This information, he says, he had from M. Dalechamps—the
editor of Pliny—and he, again, from M. de la
Tourette, who was present, in 1522, when its last stones were
finally removed to build the castle.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>About the middle of the last century, the Greek
sculptures built into the walls of the fortress were
published in Dalton’s “Views in Greece and Egypt,
1751-81,” and were subsequently described by Choiseul-Gouffier,
Moritt, Prokesch von Osten, W. J. Hamilton,
as, also, in the second volume of “Ionian Antiquities.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Nothing, however, was done towards a more
complete examination of them, till, in 1845, Sir Stratford
Canning (now Lord Stratford de Redcliffe), then
H.M. Ambassador at Constantinople, was able to extract
them from these walls, and to present them to
the British Museum in February, 1846. The chief
subject of these sculptures is the contest between the
Greeks and the Amazons, and their artistic style may
be compared with that of the slabs on the Choragic
monument of Lysicrates at Athens, of the date of B.C.
334. The pieces thus recovered were evidently but
subordinate portions of a much larger design.</p>

<p class='c015'>From this time nothing further was done till Mr.
Newton was sent by Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, in
the early part of 1856, on a cruise to the south of the
Archipelago; on which occasion he landed at Budrum,
and partially examined the site, but without detecting
any visible evidence of the Mausoleum.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c016'><sup>[38]</sup></a> In
October of the same year, however, Mr. Newton took
up his abode at Budrum with a few sappers under the
command of Lieut. Smith, R.E. Mr. Newton commenced
his excavations on the same spot he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>previously slightly examined, and, for some time, met
with little except abundant mosaics, the remains of
a splendid villa, some of them inscribed with the
names of the persons represented,—such as Meleager
and Atalanta, Dido and Æneas. A little further on,
Mr. Newton found in the rubble several drums of
columns, with late and shallow Doric flutings, and,
at one corner of the building, a well, in which was
a small head in white marble, a bronze lamp, and
some other objects: many, too, of the rooms still
retained their skirting of white marble. But still
no Mausoleum appeared.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r38'>38</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Admiral Spratt, R.N., a veteran surveyor, proposed his site
for the Mausoleum, because, 1. he thought it coincided with
the description of Vitruvius; 2. on the eastern side there are
still portions of an Hellenic wall; 3. on the N. side were several
fragments of columns of large diameter; and, 4. it might be
inferred that the Mausoleum stood on a mound. He did not,
however, follow the example of Prof. Ross, in writing a paper
against Mr. Newton’s early account of the Mausoleum in the
“Classical Museum,” with a sneer at the possibility of any
student, who had not himself surveyed the place, forming a
conception of the real position of the great building. It is satisfactory
to know that Prof. Ross’s personal survey proved to be
even less satisfactory than that of Capt. Spratt.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>At length, however, Mr. Newton commenced digging
on a spot where, nearly sixty years ago, Professor
Donaldson had noticed the remains of “a superb
Ionic edifice,” and soon came on many small fragments
of a frieze in high relief, and on a portion of a
colossal lion resembling in execution the lions’ heads
built into the walls of the castle. Mr. Newton next fell
in with a mass of ruins lying just below the surface,
one column, indeed, standing nearly upright but inverted,
and 10 feet below, a little further on, with the
edge of a pavement or step, about 6 inches below
which the native rock had been levelled for a floor.
In the earth on this floor was found the body of a
colossal statue from the waist to the ankle, and
another mass of sculpture—a warrior on horseback
in a Persian or Oriental costume, in itself a most
remarkable specimen of ancient sculpture. There
could be no doubt now that these were relics of
the Mausoleum, the smoothed rock being the bed
on which the building had once stood. The work, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>all cases, was of the best, the fragments of the small
figures being generally better preserved than those on
the frieze already in the British Museum. The discovery
of the column just alluded to had this especial
value, that, by its measurement and order, a judgment
could be formed of the size of the building to which
it had belonged: ultimately these measurements
showed that the building itself must have had much
resemblance in style to the temple at Priene.</p>

<p class='c015'>By the spring of the next year (1857) Mr. Newton
had determined the base-lines of the original building,
and proved it must have been a parallelogram 116
feet long on the west by 126 feet on the south side,
its entire circumference having been about 472 feet.
The inner part of this quadrangle was paved with
large slabs of a greenish-grey stone 1 foot thick.
The cause of the ruin of the building was, also,
clear enough; first, earthquakes shook down a considerable
portion, and then the Knights of Rhodes,
and, after them, the Turks, used up every available
stone above ground for building purposes. Fortunately,
however, the plunderers only took what was
ready to their hand; hence the massive courses of
the foundation-stones were left, because unseen. On
the western side, a grand staircase of twelve steps,
30 feet wide, led from the base of the hill to the
western side of the precincts of the Mausoleum.
Near these were found the vase of Xerxes, and a
gigantic stone weighing more than ten tons, which
probably once closed the entrance to the actual
tomb. No remains of the tomb itself were found;
yet, there is reason for believing that some portion
of it, if not the actual body of the king, was visible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>during the demolition by the Knights. On the east
side of the Mausoleum, a colossal seated male figure
was next discovered, of a grand style, but sadly shattered;
and then, on the north, a similarly colossal
female figure, which must have been originally scarcely
less than 12 feet high. Here, also, was found a very
beautiful fragment of one of the friezes, representing
a female figure stepping into a chariot, the face of
which, happily but slightly injured, retains even now
the finish of a cameo.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Newton’s next plan of ascertaining, if possible,
the boundary-wall of the <i>temenos</i> was a happy one, as
he thus, at once, discovered a mass of marble blocks,
piled one above another, and intermixed with fragments
of statues; and thus unearthed, (1) a colossal
horse, in two pieces, and part of the head of another
horse, with the bronze bridle still adhering to it; (2)
a lion in fine condition, and another in two pieces;
(3) a draped female figure broken in half; (4) a head
of Apollo. All these sculptures were found heaped
together, and had evidently not been disturbed since
they had fallen.</p>

<p class='c015'>The conclusion was inevitable, that parts of the
colossal horses of the quadriga from the top of the
monument had now been met with; and that this
quadriga and much of the pyramid, its support, had
been simply hurled upon and over the wall of the
<i>temenos</i>, and that Mr. Newton had, in fact, found them
just as they had fallen, it may be 1,700 years ago.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c016'><sup>[39]</sup></a>
Near to the horse’s head, too, was found a face of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>colossal male head, presumably that of some personage
connected with the quadriga, and, from its general
style, which is analogous to the idealized portrait of
Alexander the Great on the coins of Lysimachus, most
likely from a statue of Mausolus himself. The face has
a noble expression, and by a happy accident, the outlines
of the features have remained uninjured. Though
we have no actual evidence on this subject, it is probable
that the statue we have called Mausolus was
standing in the chariot at the top of the monument.
On the south side of the building Mr. Newton found
several portions of what, when put together, were clearly
parts of one of its wheels. The fragments consisted
of part of the outer circle, half the nave, and a piece
of one of the spokes. The wheel, originally, had six
spokes, the alternate intervals between each spoke having
been closed to ensure by its solidity the strength
of the whole wheel. As what has been found shows
that the wheel was 7.7 inches in diameter; and as
the horses could scarcely have been less than 10 feet
in length, we may fairly suppose the top of the pyramid
on which the quadriga stood was at least 24 feet long.
From other calculations it may be shown that the
pyramid was 23½ feet high: but for these and other
similar details we must refer our readers to Mr. Newton’s
work on the Mausoleum.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r39'>39</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is reasonable to conjecture that the first ruin of the
Mausoleum was due to the earthquakes of the first and second
centuries A.D., to which we have already alluded.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>We must, however, add that the measurements of
the height and tread of the blocks of marble believed
to have been the steps of the pyramid, formed an
essential feature of the calculation. The results
arrived at were mainly due to the ingenuity and
mathematical knowledge of Lieut. Smith, R.E., who
was also able to distribute Pliny’s 36 columns over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>a circumference of 412 feet, so as to preserve a
uniform intercolumniation on each side of the
building.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='c001'>STEPS OF THE PYRAMID.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The difficulty of Lieutenant Smith’s theory is that
so large a space from the centres of the columns to
the walls of the cella is left unsupported; but the plan
of support he has suggested occurs in other and
nearly contemporaneous structures, as, for instance,
in a tomb at Mylasa. Again the great height, 65
feet, between the bases of the columns and the
ground, is found to agree with the proportions of
other tombs, as in Lycia and at Souma in Algeria.
In all probability, this lofty basement was ornamented
by one or more friezes, while the lions, of which
Mr. Newton found remains of no less than fourteen,
may have stood between the columns or at the corners,
looking out on the plain. Since their arrival
in England, great skill has been shown in uniting
the innumerable fragments into which some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>slabs and statues had been broken; and visitors to
the British Museum are now able to form a good
idea of the grandeur and beauty of the equestrian or
Amazonian figure, whose costume resembles that of
the Persians on the temple of the Wingless Victory
at Athens; and of the two great statues it has been
agreed to call Mausolus and Artemisia. In the same
room, there may, also, now be seen the whole of the
frieze that has been recovered; and it is interesting
to observe how much less injured are the portions excavated
by Mr. Newton, than those which, built into
the castle wall, have for four centuries, at least, been
exposed to the corroding action of the sea-breezes.</p>

<p class='c015'>We take next <span class='sc'>Cnidus</span>, at the S.W. end of Asia
Minor, and, after Halicarnassus, the most celebrated
city of Caria. The description of its position by
Strabo and Pausanias coincides exactly with the observations
of modern travellers. Thus, Strabo speaks
of its two ports, one of which can be closed; and
of an island (now Cape Krio) in front of the city,
lofty, in the form of a theatre, and joined by a causeway
to the mainland; both of which statements are
completely confirmed by Beaufort and Hamilton. Pausanias
adds that the island was connected by a bridge.
The whole district is covered by ruins, the northern
wall being, according to Hamilton, nearly perfect:
he adds, that “there is a round tower of great beauty
at the extremity of the peninsula, near the northern
harbour” (ii. 40). Some of the most important architectural
features of the town may be seen in the
“Ionian Antiquities.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Cnidus is noticed first in the Homeric hymns, and
later as a Lacedæmonian colony, and as a member
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>of the Dorian Hexapolis, or assembly of six cities,
whose place of meeting was the temple of the Triopian
Apollo, on Cape Krio.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c016'><sup>[40]</sup></a> As a population, the Cnidians
were great traders, combining with this a love for, and
a high sense of, art. Thus we find them at a remote
period in Egypt (Herod. ii. 178), and possessing
a treasury at Delphi, while Lipara, near Sicily, was
one of their colonies. In the various wars of the fifth
and fourth centuries B.C., we find the Cnidians sometimes
on one side and sometimes on the other. Thus,
they submitted to Harpagus, the general of Cyrus;<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c016'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
then supported Athens, then deserted her after her
losses in Sicily,<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c016'><sup>[42]</sup></a> and then, again, in Roman times, were,
generally, on the side of Rome.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a> The Cnidians derived
much fame from their patronage of art. Thus, the
famous painting of Polygnotus in the Lesche at Delphi
was their gift;<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c016'><sup>[44]</sup></a> as were also a statue of Jupiter at Olympia,
and one at Delphi, of their founder, Triopas; with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>other statues of Leto, of Apollo, and of Artemis shooting
arrows at Tityus. The most famous art-possession of
Cnidus was the naked statue by Praxiteles so well
known as the Cnidian Venus,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c016'><sup>[45]</sup></a> of which abundant
notices are extant, especially in Lucian. It stood in
a chamber with two doors, so that it could be seen all
round, and many people visited Cnidus solely for this
purpose. So proud were the Cnidians of this statue
that, when Nicomedes offered to pay the whole public
debt of Cnidus in return for the statue, they preferred
keeping their statue and their debts. This statue,
justly considered the fittest representation of the
“Regina Cnidi Paphique,” continued long uninjured,
and is mentioned by Philostratus in his life of Apollonius
of Tyana; but, in the reign of Theodosius,
having been removed to Constantinople, it was totally
destroyed by fire in the palace of Lausus, about
A.D. 475. There were also preserved at Cnidus two
statues by Bryaxis and Scopas, two of the sculptors
of the Mausoleum. Cnidus was also famous for her
pottery, well known in ancient times by the name of
“Κεράμια Κνίδια.”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c016'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>The report of the Dilettanti Society, to which we
have alluded, and those of Captain Beaufort and
others, having excited much interest in England, it
was thought advisable that careful excavations should
be made at a spot where there was so much promise
of successful results; hence Mr. Newton, at the
close of his work at Halicarnassus, resolved to do
for Cnidus what he had done for the other Carian
city.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/ip074.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='c001'>DEMETER FROM CNIDUS.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c015'>Mr. Newton commenced his operations by examining
a platform supported by polygonal masonry, and
jutting out like a pier from the side of the mountain,
soon discerning that he was on the site of the <i>temenos</i>
of Demeter, as a niche in the face of the rock above
still retained a portion of a dedicatory inscription to
that goddess. Shortly afterwards he found a small <i>stele</i>,
and, near it, the statue noticed by the Dilettanti mission,
the head, hands, and feet of which were wanting.
Enough, however, remained to show that it had once
been a work “of fine style and execution.” Inscriptions
soon after turned up on the same spot: one of them
recording the dedication of an edifice (οἶκος) and of a
statue (ἄγαλμα) to Demeter and Persephone, and,
what was of far higher interest, the head of the seated
figure just noticed, exhibiting a countenance of exquisite
beauty, with a most tender and refined expression.
This head has recently been specially studied
by Professor Brunn, and his paper on it (translated
by Mr. Murray, of the British Museum) published in
vol. xi. pt. 1 of the Trans. of the Royal Society of
Literature. In this paper Professor Brunn traces, with
a masterly hand, the intercrossing ideas suggested by
the mixed character of Demeter as a wife, a mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and a widow. “The character,” says he, “of mother
pervades the whole mythology of Demeter: the
mother who, without a husband, lived only for her
child; who had to lose her child, and to be filled with
anxiety for her; to have her anxiety lessened, but
never silenced or removed, by occasional visits from
her daughter.... The eye is sunk in the socket,
as if physically weary; but anxiety of mind fights
against the weariness, and will not yet surrender to it.
The look is not sunk, but is directed upwards, only a
little less sharply.” ... “Can it be,” adds the
Professor, “only the result of chance that Christian
artists have also represented the Madonna wearing
the veil? ... In the centre of the Christian
religion, also, is the figure of a mother who lives only
for her Child and in her Child, who, in the same way,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>grieves for the loss of her Son, and finds blessedness
in the spiritual contemplation of Him. Suppose a
Christian artist were to give his Madonna the head of
our Demeter, he would certainly not be censured
for it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>About the same time Mr. Newton met with two
other statues, each of considerable interest: the one
representing a female figure with a modius on her
head, partially covered by the peplos, and in her right
hand a pomegranate; the other, a female statue nearly
six feet high, with its body draped to the feet. Its
general character is that of an elderly woman wasted
with sorrow, with little of that matronly comeliness
which, in ancient art, generally characterizes Demeter.
From the Homeric hymn to Demeter we learn that
the goddess, while wandering in search of her daughter
Persephone, was wont to assume the garb of an old
woman, and thus traversed the earth for days without
tasting food. She is likened, also, to an aged nurse
or housekeeper in a regal house, a description well
agreeing with this statue. This type of the sorrowing
Demeter has not, we believe, been previously recognized
in any extant monument of ancient art. A
passage, however, in Clemens Alexandrinus (Cohort. ad
Gentes, i. 30, ed. Potter) suggests that she was sometimes
represented in sculpture under this aspect.</p>

<p class='c015'>Near the first statue of Demeter, the sitting figure,
were several thin nearly decayed sheets of lead,
which, on being unrolled, proved to have been inscribed
with curses and imprecations in the names
of Demeter, Persephone, and other of the infernal
gods. Such inscriptions have been occasionally met
with before, and are known by the name of <i>Diræ</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>On pursuing his researches in this <i>temenos</i>, Mr. Newton
came upon the entrance to a large chamber, full
of miscellaneous antiquities, including many bases of
former statues, some with remains of stelæ, others
with hollowed spaces for the feet of statues. Most
of them bore dedications to Demeter in the Doric
dialect; and, with them, were many other objects
connected with her worship, as three boar pigs, a
calathus, and many votive female breasts in marble.
The date of these objects is probably, as Mr. Newton
suggests, about B.C. 370-320. Below these, again,
were layers of lamps, <i>amphoriskoi</i>, vessels in Samian
ware, hair-pins of bone, bodkins, and glass bottles, all
probably Roman. It is likely that this chamber was
formerly a treasury connected with one of the temples;
and, that it has never been disturbed since it became
a ruin is certain from the fact that the edges of the
fractured stones are still clean and sharp. It is curious
that, besides the marble pigs, the bones of many young
pigs were also found, manifest remains of sacrifices to
Demeter.</p>

<p class='c015'>The clearing out of the Theatres did little to reward
Mr. Newton’s labours; indeed, it soon became
but too clear that all, or nearly all, the finer works
had long since been removed, probably, like the
Venus, to Constantinople. Hence, shortly afterwards,
he gave his chief attention to a thorough examination
of the Necropolis, the vast extent of which naturally
inspired hopes of important discoveries. This necropolis,
the general character of which is very well shown
in one of the plates in the “Ionian Antiquities,” must
in former days have been one of the most striking
features of the town. One of the structures still remaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span><i>in situ</i> was, Mr. Newton observes, not unlike
in form to an early Christian church, with a chamber,
vestibule, and apse or alcove at the south end. On
each side were smaller apses, and, in front of each of
them, a marble sarcophagus. The sarcophagi generally
exhibit good Roman work of the time of Domitian,
but have suffered much by the fall of the roof; they
must once have been magnificent specimens of the
decorative style of their day, though they exhibit the
decay of good taste in the lavish prodigality of ornament
with which they have been covered. In the
earth around were abundant fragments of Greek inscriptions,
nearly all of them decrees of the Senate
and people of Cnidus. One of the tombs Mr. Newton
considered to have been that of a certain Lykæthus,
as an inscription records decrees in his favour, by
show of hands (χειροτονία), at the festival of the
greater Dionysia, together with the erection of a statue
to him at the public expense. There is no satisfactory
proof as to when this Lykæthus lived; but
his tomb would seem to date from the early Seleucidan
period, when Cnidus was a free city.</p>

<p class='c015'>Having completed the survey of Cnidus itself, Mr.
Newton proceeded next to examine the villages in the
neighbourhood, the result being the discovery of a
colossal lion. Reports of its existence had reached
him before, but it was left to Mr. Pullan, the architect
of the expedition, to make its actual discovery,
at a distance of between three and four miles to
the E. of Cnidus, in a position wherein, except by
accident, it might have remained unnoticed for another
twenty-one centuries. The exact spot where the
lion was found may be seen in the Admiralty chart,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>which shows, on the summit of a cliff, opposite Cape
Crio, the ruins of an ancient tomb, which are strewn
all around. Below this, some 60 feet, the lion was
reposing on a ledge of rock, beneath which, again,
is a sheer precipice of 300 feet into the sea. The
lion was lying on its right side, and its upper portion
had suffered much from exposure to the weather. It
had been carved, as well as the base on which it reposes,
of one piece of Parian marble, and measures
nearly 10 ft. in length, by 6 ft. in height. This noble
lion is probably earlier than the Mausoleum, and exhibits
a more severe and majestic style than those
of the Mausoleum.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a> The removal of the lion was a
labour of much toil and difficulty; indeed, could
hardly have been accomplished had Mr. Newton not
had the aid of some sailors from an English ship of war.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r47'>47</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See Frontispiece.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The tomb itself was a nearly equal square of
39 ft. 2¾ inches, with the remains of a pyramid like
that of the Mausoleum.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Its present height is
about 17 ft.; the four lower feet being composed of
immense blocks of marble, supporting eleven courses
of travertine. On the west, and most perfect side,
a portion of the lower step of the stylobate still
remains. No <i>data</i> have been obtained of the exact
height of the columns once round the monument;
but, as, in an angle step, one tread was 13½ inches,
and the other only 10½, it is clear that this structure,
like the Mausoleum, was oblong. Although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>the action of an earthquake was probably the primary
cause of the ruin of this monumental tomb, there can
be no doubt, also, that it has suffered much from
plunderers, who, in search for treasure, have torn up
as much of the inner pavement as they could move.
The jambs of the doorway still exist, and the interior
was shaped like a beehive. The top has been closed
in by one immense block, and, as its upper side was
somewhat broader than the lower, this block must
have been dropped into its position, like the bung of
a gigantic cask, after the rest of the building was
finished. The chamber, itself, exhibits in its sides a
series of openings expanding outwards like embrasures—no
doubt, θῆκαι, or resting-places for bodies:
indeed, on clearing the rubbish away, a number of
human bones were met with. Mr. Newton considers
this monument can hardly be later than 350 B.C.,
and that it was built as a monument to many citizens
who had fallen in battle. To what period, then, can
it be assigned? Probably to either the repulse of
the Athenians by the Cnidians in B.C. 412; or to
the defeat of the Lacedæmonians by Conon in B.C.
394; and, of the two, it is more likely it was erected
in commemoration of the former event, which was
one of much glory to the town. To the north and
further inland, are two other tombs of precisely similar
construction, but inferior in size.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r48'>48</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Falkener found at Ouran, in Phrygia, a monument

<p class='c015'>Having now devoted a considerable space to Halicarnassus
and Cnidus, owing to their being, from
recent researches, of such high importance, we must
notice very briefly the other towns of Caria. The
small town of <span class='sc'>Physcus</span> is chiefly of interest for its magnificent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>bay and harbour, so well known to modern
navigators (under the name of Marmorice), as one of
the finest in the world for vessels of the largest size.
Possibly it was this very character that led to its
being so little noticed in antiquity, as ancient galleys
did not value depth of water. The capacity of the
bay of Marmorice will be best comprehended, when
we remind our readers that Nelson anchored his
whole fleet within it, just before the battle of the
Nile. Not far from this was <span class='sc'>Caunus</span>, the ancient
capital of a population whom Herodotus held were
not Carians; indeed, their coins and architecture
seem to prove them Lycians. The site of Caunus
has been identified, there being still considerable
monumental remains and walls of so-called Cyclopean
masonry. The Caunians were an active and high-spirited
race, and made a gallant resistance to the
Persians, a few years later joining with equal enthusiasm
in the great Ionian revolt (Herod. v. 103).
Towards the close of the Peloponnesian war we find
Caunus constantly mentioned. Having been rejected
by the Romans in a petition against Rhodes, they
conceived against them the bitterest hatred, and
hence carried out with great atrocity the massacre of
the Romans planned by Mithradates (Appian, Mithr.
c. 23). Caunus was so unhealthy in the summer
that “pale-faced Caunians” became a proverb.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Stratonicea</span> (now Eski-hissar), one of the chief
inland towns of Caria and mainly built by Antiochus
Soter, derived its name from his wife Stratonice.
The great Mithradates married thence his wife
Monima. Not far from the town was the famous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>temple of Jupiter Chrysaorius, the centre of the
political union of the Carian states. Stratonicea has
been much explored by travellers; and, so early as
1709, Mr. Consul Sherard presented to the Earl of
Oxford a book of Greek inscriptions copied by him
at various places in Asia Minor. This volume is
now in the Harleian collection. The most important
monument of the town is the celebrated edict of
Diocletian—in Greek and Latin—the first copy of
which, by Sherard, is in the volume just mentioned.
The late Colonel Leake<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a> has shown that its date is
about A.D. 303, and its object to direct those engaged
in the traffic of provisions not to exceed certain
fixed prices in times of scarcity. Fellows states that
the names of many of the articles of food enumerated
therein are still used by the peasantry of Asia Minor.
<i>Inter alia</i>, we learn that silken garments were in
common use, as Ammianus<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a> pointed out, seventy
years later; as also the rough coat or <i>birrhus</i>, the
<i>caracallis</i>, or hooded cloak (afterwards adopted by
the monks), the Gallic breeches and socks. The late
date of the inscription is shown by its barbarous
Latinity, above all, by the reduced value of the
<i>drachma</i> or <i>denarius</i>. Thus a denarius appears as the
equivalent of a single oyster, or of the hundredth
part of a lean goose! The names of the provisions
recorded not only indicate the ordinary food of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>people, but also the costly dainties of the epicure.
Thus several kinds of honey, of hams, of sausages,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
of salt and fresh-water fish, of asparagus and of beans,
are noted. Gibbon has not failed to notice this
inscription, though, in his day, it had been very imperfectly
copied.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r51'>51</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The derivation of the word “sausage” may not be generally known.
“Icicium” means “minced meat”; “salsum icicium,” the same salted.
From the latter comes the Italian <i>salsiccio</i>, the French
<i>saucisse</i>, and the English sausage. So <i>jecur ficatum</i>
(Greek, συκωτὸν), hog’s liver, derived from the fattening of
geese with figs (“pinguibus et ficis pastum jecur anseris albi,”
Horat. Satir. ii. 8, 88) is preserved in the Italian
<i>fegato</i> and the modern Greek συκώτι, used for liver in
general. It is curious to meet on a decree on the walls of a
temple in Caria with <i>pernæ Menapicæ</i>, Westphalian hams.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Aphrodisias</span> was a considerable place, and, at a
very late period, as appears from Hierocles, the capital
of Caria. It is but little mentioned in ancient
history, but Tacitus records that, setting forth decrees
of Cæsar and Augustus in its favour,<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a> it pleaded before
the Senate for the right of sanctuary attached to
its temples, when Tiberius was wisely attempting to
abridge these injurious immunities. Aphrodisias was
chiefly famous for its magnificent Ionic temple of
Venus, many columns of which are still standing.
They may be seen in the third volume of the “Ionian
Antiquities,” 1840,<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a> and in Mr. Pullan’s work.</p>

first copied by Sherard, confirms the statement of Tacitus.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r53'>53</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The name of Aphrodisias was more than once changed.
Thus when Christianity began to prevail, the first change was to
Tauropolis (as is shown on an inscription copied by Fellows),
and, again, to Stauropolis (or the city of the Cross). When,
however, towards the end of the fifth century, the festivals of
Venus were revived by Asclepiodotus of Alexandria, the ancient
name was revived also.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Sir Charles Fellows has given an excellent description
(Lycia, p. 32) of the state in which he found the
ruins, with a beautiful drawing of the Ionic temple.
“I never,” says he, “saw in one place so many perfect
remains, although by no means of a good age of the
arts”: he thinks, too, that the early city must have
been in great measure destroyed. “These (the later)
walls are,” he adds, “composed of the remains of
temples, tombs, and theatres removed, although uninjured.
The reversed inscriptions, and inverted bas-reliefs
bear testimony to this change.” Sir Charles
Fellows quotes one inscription as showing how carefully
the owners of these tombs endeavoured to secure
their preservation and sole occupancy. “But if,”
says the legend, “contrary to these directions, anybody
shall bury another (in this monument), let him be
accursed, and besides pay into the most holy treasury
5,000 denarii, of which one-third is to be his who
institutes the proceedings.” Inscriptions with similar
curses are, indeed, common enough.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Mylasa</span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Labranda</span> may be taken together, as
from the former a Sacred Way led to Labranda. The
former was, no doubt, in early times one of the chief
places in Caria, before Halicarnassus was adopted as
the royal residence; indeed, we find a proof of this
in the fact that it had a temple to which Lydians and
Mysians were alike admitted (Herod, i. 171). Physcus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>to which we have already referred was considered as
its port. Mylasa, in ancient times, as Strabo avers,
a city of great beauty, owed much to its having been
built close to a mountain of the finest white marble.
It was, indeed, so close, that one of the provincial
governors observed that the founder of the town
ought to have been ashamed of his blunder, if not
frightened.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c016'><sup>[54]</sup></a> It was, also, so full of sacred buildings,
that when Stratonicus came there, thinking there were
more temples than people, he exclaimed, in the
middle of the forum, “Hear, oh ye temples”!
(Athen. viii. p. 348).</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f54'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r54'>54</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Strabo’s words are: Ταύτην γὰρ, ἔφη, τὴν πόλιν ὁ κτίσας εἰ μὴ
ἐφοβεῖτο, ἆρ’ οὐδ’ ᾐσχύνετο; (xiv. 659).</p>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c015'>The people of Mylasa having made a successful
resistance to the attacks of Philip, the son of Demetrius,
were rewarded by being made “free” by
the Romans. Modern travellers, from Pococke to
Chandler, fully confirm the statements of the ancients
as to the abundance of marble monuments; and
Colonel Leake adds that, since they were there, the
Turks have pulled down the best ruin, that of the
Temple of Romulus and Augustus. Sir Charles
Fellows, on his second journey, observed on the key-stone
of a gateway the double-headed axe (bipennis),
indicating that the building to which it belonged had
once been consecrated to the Jupiter of Labranda,
a name said to have been derived from λαβρὺς, the
Carian word for an axe;<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a> and succeeded, also,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>in identifying it (pp. 66-67). He says of it,
“The only conspicuous building of the place is a
beautiful temple of the Corinthian order, but I think
not of the finest age.... It stands in a recess
in the hills, and is consequently not seen without
approaching close to it.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f55'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r55'>55</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Strabo calls the temple νεὠς άρχαῖος, and Herodotus adds
that there was a holy grove of plane-trees near it, ἅγιον ἂλσος πλατανίστων
(v. 119). Plutarch (ii. p. 302 A) states that
λαβρὺς was the Lydian and Carian word for axe (which we find
represented also on the coins of Mausolus and Pixodarus). On
one of the Oxford marbles (ii. 12), probably an altar, occur the
words Διός Λαβραύνδου.</p>

by Mr. Pullan, who states that the building (of which
the fifteen columns still stand) is really of Roman times and
work, though engraved (under the auspices of Dr. Chandler) as
a Greek temple in the “Ionian Antiquities,” vol. i. (Pullan,
“Ruins of Asia Minor,” p. 26).</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>We</span> come now to <i>Lycia</i>, of which many of the
most important monuments are now in the Lycian
room at the British Museum—for the most part the
records of its chief town, <span class='sc'>Xanthus</span>—and all procured
by Sir Charles Fellows. A few less valuable
remains, were, at the same time, obtained from other
Lycian towns.</p>
<p class='c015'>The chief value of the monuments from <i>Lycia</i> lies
in this, that, while they exhibit many well-executed
pieces of sculpture, interesting as a local or provincial
rendering of Greek work of the middle of the fourth
century B.C., they comprise, also, a few slabs, as, for
instance, those from the Harpy tomb, of a genuine
Archaic type.</p>

<p class='c015'>Xanthus, the town from which the greater part of
the monuments about to be described have been
secured, underwent remarkable vicissitudes of fortune,
some of which, it has been thought, are indicated on
its sculptures. Originally, it was a Cretan colony
settled at or near Xanthus; hence we read, in the
Iliad, of Sarpedon and Glaucus, as the leaders of the
Lycians in the Trojan army, and of the body of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>former being carried back by Sleep and Death to
Lycia to be honoured with a <i>stele</i> and tomb. Pandarus,
too, the celebrated archer, is also a Lycian. On
the overthrow of Crœsus, Harpagus, Cyrus’s general,
was sent to reduce Lycia with a mixed force of Persians,
Dorians, and Ionians; the Glaucidæ, or royal
family of Lycia, having vigorously supported the
Ionians in their resistance to Cyrus.</p>

<p class='c015'>On this occasion Xanthus made a memorable
defence. It is said that, when driven from the plain
by the united forces of the Persian and confederate
army, its people took refuge in their citadel, and,
collecting therein their wives, children, and treasures,
burnt them, at the same time falling to a man in a
furious sally upon their enemies (Herod, i. 176).
That the Persian success was complete, we know
from the fact, that, sixty years later, the then Xanthians
sent fifty ships to the aid of Xerxes, and continued,
subsequently, to pay an annual tax to the
Persian monarchs.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a> Yet their courage was not
subdued; for when Alexander, after his victory over
the Persians at the Graneicus, descended into Lycia,
at Xanthus, and there alone, he met with an obstinate
resistance.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f57'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r57'>57</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It has been suggested (see Rawlinson’s Herodotus, i. p. 312)
that the family of Harpagus continued to govern Lycia, and that
the Xanthian obelisk (to which we shall presently refer) was
erected soon after the battle of Eurymedon, B.C. 466. But
“son of Harpagus,” on that monument, may easily mean no
more than his descendant, just as Jehu was called “the son of
Omri.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>In the subsequent war, the Xanthians supported
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Antigonus; hence the assault and capture of the town
by Ptolemy; and, during the war between Brutus and
the Triumvirs, the former entered Lycia, and a bloody
attack on, and siege of, Xanthus were the natural
results. We are told, that on this occasion, the people
of the town did as they had done before when
assaulted by Harpagus, destroying themselves, their
wives, and their children, in a similar holocaust.
Subsequently, we hear little of Xanthus, except
that it suffered severely from the two great earthquakes
in the days of Tiberius and Antoninus Pius.
The town of Xanthus was situated on the left bank
of the Sirbes<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c016'><sup>[58]</sup></a> or Sirbus, called Xanthus or the Yellow
by the Greeks; at a distance of between 6 and 7
miles from the sea. On the highest point was the
Acropolis, a Roman work, built chiefly out of the
ruins of the older town. On the brow of the hill
stood what has been called the Harpy tomb.</p>

We regret, however, we cannot accept his view, that
the subject of these sculptures is the capture of
Xanthus by Harpagus, as this event took place in
B.C. 545; while none of these reliefs can be as early

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r59'>59</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the whole, it seems most likely that this monument was
the sanctuary of some local hero, possibly of the original founder
or leader (οἰκιστής or ἀρχηγέτης), like the Theseum at Athens.
It might, therefore, have been the Harpageum, or memorial of
Harpagus, or of the Harpagi. Mr. Benjamin Gibson has supposed
that the “Trophy monument” was intended to commemorate
“the conquest of Lycia by the united forces of the
Persians and Ionians” (Mus. of Class. Antiq. vol. i. 132); and
Mr. Watkiss Lloyd has published an able memoir on it, entitled
“Xanthian Marbles—the Nereid Monument.”</p>

heraldry” (as in the case of <i>Arpi</i> in Apulia, and of <i>Zancle</i> in

the size of life, running along the ground.</p>

<p class='c015'>3. The Tombs. The tomb-system, so to speak,
as developed in Lycia, is a striking characteristic
of that province, and has been, therefore, carefully
studied by Sir Charles Fellows, who has classed them,
according to their forms, under the heads of Obelisk,
Gothic, and Elizabethan. The first, as the name implies,
is simply a square block surmounted by a cap and cornice;
the second and third have lancet-head tops or deep
mullioned recesses, respectively. Of the two first the
British Museum has excellent specimens; the third
was chiefly used for carvings on the face of solid
rocks. All alike exhibit imitations of wooden structures
with panelled doors, bossed nails, and knockers
suspended from lions’ mouths. One of these tombs,
the so-called Harpy tomb, from its great curiosity, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>must notice somewhat fully. It consists of a square
column about 17½ feet high, in one piece of stone,
surmounted by a series of bas-reliefs, forming the
walls of a square chamber, seven feet each way, and
having a small door on its west side. On these walls
are representations of Harpies, between whom, in each
case, is a group consisting of one seated and one
standing figure. There is reason to suppose the subject
of these reliefs a local myth, and, as the daughters
of a Lycian hero, Pandarus, are said to have been
carried off by Harpies, this is not improbably the
subject here. Harpies are usually, as here, indicated
with the faces, breasts, and hands of women, and with
bodies and feet of vultures. It is possible that this
<i>stele</i> may have been the tomb of some prince of the
royal family of Lycia, who claimed descent from the
mythical hero, Pandarus. No certain date can be
assigned to it; but, had it been executed in Attica
instead of Lycia, B.C. 530 would not have been too
early for it. In any case, its execution must have
preceded the Persian conquest of Lycia.</p>

<p class='c015'>One of the most interesting of the Gothic tombs
is that of a man whose name has been read
Paiafa, and who was, probably a satrap of Lycia. The
top of this structure much resembles an inverted boat,
with a high ridge running along it, like a keel. On each
side of the roof is an armed figure in a <i>quadriga</i>;<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c016'><sup>[64]</sup></a> on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>north side, below the <i>tympanum</i>, the Satrap is seated as
a judge, his dress and general appearance being the
same as that of the Persian on the Trophy monument.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f64'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r64'>64</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Herodotus remarks that the people of Bithynia carried two
Lycian spears, and had helmets of brass, on the summits of which
were the ears and horns of an ox. Cf. also, on coins, the
helmet of Eukratides, king of Bactriana.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>In concluding these notes on Xanthus, we may
allude to some casts from a tomb at Pinara, hard by,
carved on the face of the solid rock. Sir Charles
Fellows states that, in the centre of this city, there rises
a round rocky cliff, speckled all over with tombs, many
of them being only oblong holes, and quite inaccessible.
One cast gives the representation of a walled
city with tombs, towers, gates, and walls; the battlements,
on the whole, much resembling the town shown
on the “Trophy monument.” Another cast gives the
interior of the portico of a rock tomb at Tlos, with
Bellerophon, one of the heroes of Lycia, triumphing
over the Chimæra.</p>

<p class='c015'>It only remains for us to notice the famous
<i>Inscribed Stele</i>, the longest inscription yet met with
in the Lycian character, and containing a notice of a
son of Harpagus, and the names of several Lycian
towns. On the north side, between the lines of
Lycian characters, is a Greek inscription in twelve
hexameter lines,<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c016'><sup>[65]</sup></a> the first from an epigram of Simonides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>(B.C. 556), and a notice of the achievements
of this son of Harpagus. The whole inscription consists
of about 250 lines.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f65'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r65'>65</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Colonel Leake (Trans. of the Roy. Soc. of Literature,
vol. ii. 1844) has given a translation of the twelve lines in
Greek, showing that this monument was erected by a certain
Datis, called a son of Harpagus. It states that he had gained
the highest honours in the Carian games, and had slain “in
one day seven heavy-armed soldiers, men of Arcadia.” The
epigram of Simonides (Anthol. Brunck. vol. i. p. 134) commemorates
the battles at Cyprus and on the Eurymedon,
B.C. 470. Another conjecture is that the son of Harpagus was
called Sparsis (Leake, ibid. p. 32). Colonel Leake thinks the
date of the inscription not earlier than B.C. 400.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Over the other towns of <span class='sc'>Lycia</span>, <span class='sc'>Telmessus</span>, <span class='sc'>Patara</span>,
<span class='sc'>Pinara</span>, <span class='sc'>Myra</span>, <span class='sc'>Tlos</span>, and <span class='sc'>Antiphellus</span>, it is not
necessary for us to dwell at any great length, the
more so that they were not, historically, of great importance,
and are to us only interesting for the remains
of art still visible on the spot.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Telmessus</span> was on the coast, and is now represented
by the village of Makri.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c016'><sup>[66]</sup></a> In ancient times it
was famous for the skill of its augurs. Herodotus
tells us they were often consulted by the kings of
Lydia, and especially by Crœsus; and Arrian ascribes
to them a remote antiquity. Their reputation long
survived; for Cicero speaks of the town thus:—“Telmessus
in Caria est quâ in urbe excellit haruspicum
disciplina” (De Divin. i. 41). In early Christian
times it had a bishop. Telmessus has been fully
described by Dr. Clarke and Sir Charles Fellows.
Its monumental remains are almost wholly tombs;
but these are, many of them, remarkable for their
beauty, as also for the extraordinary labour bestowed
on them in cutting them out of the face of the rock.
Sir Charles Fellows makes the curious remark, that,
though the Greek population of Lycia were mainly
Dorians, he did not meet with any tombs or other
monuments unquestionably of the Doric order.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f66'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r66'>66</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fellows remarks that the Meio of the maps and of the
“Modern Traveller” (supposed, too, by Cramer to be a corruption
of Telmessus) is not known in the country.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Patara</span>, on the left bank of the river Xanthus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>was chiefly celebrated for its worship and temples
of the Lycian Apollo, known by the appellation
of Patareus.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c016'><sup>[67]</sup></a> According to Herodotus (i. 182), the
priestess who delivered it was shut up in the temple
every night, but the oracular responses were only
occasional. The Pataræan oracle was very ancient,
and considered scarcely inferior to that of Delphi.
Captain Beaufort, in his account of Karamania, places
the remains of Patara<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c016'><sup>[68]</sup></a> near the shore, and notices
“a deep circular pit of singular appearance, which
may have been the seat of the oracle.” Fellows
alludes to “a beautiful small temple about the centre
of the ruined city,” with a doorway “of beautiful
Greek workmanship, ornamented in the Corinthian
style, and in fine proportion and scale.” The port of
Patara, which was too small to contain the combined
fleet of the Romans and Rhodians under Regillus in
the war with Antiochus (Liv. xxxvii. 17) is now completely
overgrown with brushwood, &amp;c. The theatre
is shown by an inscription to have been built (more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>probably rebuilt) in the fourth consulate of Antoninus
Pius, A.D. 145.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Pinara</span>, at the foot of Mount Cragus, was another
of the six Lycian towns in which divine honours
were paid to the hero Pandarus, Homer’s celebrated
archer: its name is said to be a Lycian word for a
round hill (v. Ἀρτύμνησος, ap. Ptol.; Plin. v. 28;
Hierocl. p. 684); and such a hill, pierced everywhere
for tombs, Fellows found, as we have stated, in the very
centre of it. Such a physical feature would not have
been overlooked by any Greeks. He adds that “the
whole city appears to be of one date and people,” the
inscriptions being generally in the Lycian character.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c016'><sup>[69]</sup></a>

the drawing he gives (p. 141), are of much interest
and beauty.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r69'>69</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Colonel Leake (Roy. Soc. Lit. i. p. 267) was of the opinion

</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Myra</span>, sometimes called Andriace (whence the
modern <i>Andraki</i>), was, according to Appian, a place
of some note, and it is still remarkable for the beauty
and richness of its rock-cut tombs (Pullan). The
Sacred historian of St. Paul’s journeyings writes that,
after quitting Sidon and Cyprus, “when we had
sailed over the Sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we
came to Myra, a city of Lycia; and there the centurion
found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, and
he put us therein” (Acts xxvii. 5, 6). Myra, at a late
period, seems to have been the metropolis of the
province (Malala, Chron. xiv.; Hierocl. p. 684).
A Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, is also mentioned
(Const. Porphyr. Themist. 14). Colonel Leake observes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>that, on the banks of the river by which Lucullus
ascended to Myra, are the ruins of a large building,
which, from an inscription, appears to have been a
granary, erected in the time of Hadrian;<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c016'><sup>[70]</sup></a> and Fellows
adds that “the tombs are generally very large, and
all appear to have been for families, some having
small chambers, one leading to the other, and some
highly interesting from their interior peculiarities of
arrangement.” Many bas-reliefs within the porticos of
the tombs still retain their original colour, as may be
seen on the casts from them in the British Museum.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f70'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r70'>70</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Beaufort gives a minute description of this building, and
states that it is 200 feet long, with walls 20 feet high. The
inscription on it, “<span class='sc'>Horrea Imp. Caesaris Divi Traiani
Hadriani</span>,” &amp;c., proves that it has been a granary: it was divided
into seven separate compartments.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Tlos</span> and <span class='sc'>Antiphellus</span>, though occasionally mentioned
in ancient times, had been well-nigh forgotten
till these and other sites were diligently sought out by
modern travellers. Leake speaks of the latter as containing
a theatre nearly complete, with many catacombs
and sarkophagi, some very large and magnificent; and
Fellows thinks the tombs here the largest in Lycia.
“The rocks for miles round,” he says, “are strewn
with their fragments, and many hundreds are still
standing, apparently unopened.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Tlos</span>, of which we know little more than that it lay
on the road to Cibyra, was first accurately determined
by Sir Charles Fellows, who considered the original
city must have been demolished in very early times,
as “finely-wrought fragments are now seen built into
the strong walls which have fortified the town raised
upon its ruins.” The theatre was the most highly-finished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>he had seen, for the seats were not only of
polished marble, but each seat had an overhanging
cornice, often supported by lions’ paws. An inscription
found there records the name of Sarpedon,
showing that the name of the mythical hero of Lycia
was still preserved among the people. The name for
tomb at Tlos is always Heroum.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the provinces are so closely connected, we shall
take <i>Pamphylia</i> and <i>Pisidia</i> together, simply selecting
from them such sites as seem of the highest interest.
We shall, therefore, notice first <span class='sc'>Attalia</span> (the modern
Adalia), although there has been some dispute among
geographers whether Adalia does really occupy the
site of the old city: the true course of a stream
called Catarrhactes,<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c016'><sup>[71]</sup></a> from its plunging headlong over
precipices into the sea, being still undetermined, has
mainly led to this confusion. The probability is
that, owing to the agency of earthquakes, the coastline
has been much changed during the last 2,000
years; moreover, Colonel Leake and others believe
the calcareous matter brought down, in this period by
the different streams, sufficient to cause the cessation
of any such cascade, the main stream having been also
much diverted to fertilize the gardens round the town.
The physical changes have in fact, been so great, that
it is more wonderful that anything can be determined
on a certain and satisfactory basis. Captain Beaufort
thought the modern town occupied the site of Olbia.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c016'><sup>[72]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>On the other hand, Leake considered Adalia the
representative of Attalia, and that Olbia would
probably be found in some part of the plain which
extends for seven miles from the modern Adalia to
the foot of Mount Solyma. Attalia derived its name
from Attalus Philadelphus. From it, St. Paul and St.
Barnabas, on their return, sailed to the Syrian Antioch
(Acts xiv. 25). In later times it was the seat of a
bishopric. It is now the principal southern Turkish
port of Asia Minor, and has many ancient remains.
Leake remarks on “the walls and other fortifications,
the magnificent gate or triumphal arch, bearing an inscription
in honour of Hadrian, an aqueduct, and the
numerous fragments of sculpture and architecture.”
Fellows adds:—“Adalia, which is called by the Turks
<i>Atalia</i>, I prefer to any Turkish town that I have yet
visited; every house has its garden, and consequently
the town has the appearance of a wood, and of what?—orange,
lemon, fig, vine, mulberry, all cultivated
with the artificial care of a town garden, and now
(April 3) in fresh spring beauty.” It was from Attalia,
or from its neighbourhood, that Mark “turned back”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c016'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
(Acts xiii. 13).</p>

“ceiled” with small squares of fine white marble and bearing
the curious inscription, τὸ ἔργον τῆς πλακώσεως τῆς πύλης—Πλάκωσις
does not occur in classical Greek; but πλάξ is a flat
surface, and πλακόω is to cover with such pieces. Hence,
πλακώτης μαρμάρου is one who overlays with marble. In the
commencement of their journey Attalia is not mentioned by
name, but only Perga (Acts xiii. 13).</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Nearly due N. of Attalia was <span class='sc'>Perge</span>, famous in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>olden times for the temple and worship of Artemis
Pergæa.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c016'><sup>[74]</sup></a> The date of the city is uncertain, but it
lasted, as an ecclesiastical centre, till late in the Byzantine
times. Alexander, in his march eastwards, occupied
Perge, finding, as might have been expected,
much difficulty in his advance through the adjacent
mountains; St. Paul, too, and St. Barnabas were here
twice; first, on their way from Cyprus; and, secondly,
on their return to Syria. The ruins noticed by General
Köhler, at a place called <i>Eski Kalesi</i>, were probably
those of this place. The theatre and stadium are still
quite perfect. On these walls and other buildings the
Greek shield is constantly carved, reminding the spectator
of the passage in Ezekiel, xxvii. 11, “They hanged
their shields upon thy walls round about.”</p>

<p class='c015'>On the Eurymedon was seated the old Argive
town of <span class='sc'>Aspendus</span>, some of the coins of which
read, barbarously, ΕΣΤFΕΔΝΥΣ. Thucydides speaks
of it as a seaport; but he, probably, means that it was
a boat-station at the mouth of the river. Aspendus
is noticed by Arrian, and was the place where
Thrasybulus was slain in his tent by the natives;
it is also mentioned in the campaign of Manlius
(Liv. xxxviii.; Polyb. xxii.).<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c016'><sup>[76]</sup></a> Mr. Pullan gives a beautiful
drawing of its theatre, which is by far the most
perfect in Asia Minor. One other place of considerable
reputation in Pamphylia must be briefly
noted; viz. <span class='sc'>Side</span>, a colony of the Cumæans of
Æolis, and remarkable for the fact that, soon after
they came there they forgot their native Greek tongue,
and spoke a barbarous jargon. It was off this town
the battle was fought when the fleet of Antiochus,
under Hannibal, was utterly routed by the Rhodians.
When, somewhat later, the pirates of Cilicia became so
formidable, Side was one of their chief harbours, and
one of the markets where they disposed of their ill-gotten
plunder. Side was in Roman times the capital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>of <i>Pamphylia prima</i>, and was still in existence when
Hierocles wrote. Capt. Beaufort found it utterly deserted;
but its remains would seem to be very striking,
especially its outer walls and theatre, which is not less
than 409 feet in external diameter, with a perpendicular
height, from the area, of 79 feet: all its seats are,
Capt. Beaufort says, of white marble, and the building
could have held 13,370 persons, sitting comfortably;
it is, he adds, “in a very perfect state; few of the
seats have been disturbed, even the stairs are, in
general, passable.” The same observer considered
that, at some later period, this great structure had
been converted into a fortress, as walls, with towers
and gates, but of inferior work, now extend to the
seashore.</p>

<p class='c015'>Our knowledge of the ancient geography of <i>Pisidia</i>
is mostly derived from Arrian’s notice of Alexander’s
march, from Livy’s account of the expedition of
C. Manlius Vulso, and from the details in Polybius
of the hostilities carried on by Garsyeris, the general
of Achæus, against the people of <span class='sc'>Termessus</span>, one
of its chief cities. At the time Manlius was approaching
this town the Termessians were in open
war with the people of Isionda or Isinda, and, having
captured this city, were besieging the citadel. The
Roman general was not sorry to have so good a
pretext for interfering; hence his march on Isinda,
his relief of that city, and his fining the Termessians
fifty talents. A glance at the map suggests
that he must have come in, by the defiles of
Milyas, near a place now called Al-Malu. The presumed
ruins of Isinda have been noticed by M.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Coransez, as extending over nearly a square league,
and as remarkable for their massive structure.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Termessus</span> itself was evidently at the entrance of
the defiles whereby Pisidia communicates with Pamphylia
and Lycia. Arrian says that “the men of
Termessus occupy a site very lofty and precipitous
on every side, the road passing close to the city being
very difficult, as the mountain reaches down from the
city to the road. There is over against this, another
mountain not less precipitous, and these form a gate,
as it were, on the road,” &amp;c. This statement is fully
confirmed by the observation of General Köhler (ap.
Leake, Asia Minor, pp. 133-135): “The two great
ranges on the west and north of the plains of
Adalia,” says he, “now approach each other, and, at
length, are only divided by the passes through which
the river finds its way. The road, however, leaves
this gorge to the right, and ascends the mountain by
a paved and winding causeway, a work of great labour
and ingenuity.”<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c016'><sup>[77]</sup></a> Alexander the Great, it would
seem, despaired of taking the town; or, possibly,
thought its siege would detain him too long; he,
however, forced the defiles, passing on to the north to
Cormasa, Cremna, and Sagalassus, a course probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>pursued by Manlius subsequently.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c016'><sup>[78]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Cremna</span>, where,
owing to its great natural strength, the Romans
placed a colony (Strab. xii. 569), has been carefully
examined by Mr. Davis (“Anatolica,” p. 182), who
gives also a plan, showing the construction of this
remarkable fortress. His description is as follows:<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c016'><sup>[79]</sup></a>
“It (Kremna) is a plateau of limestone, which is
bounded on three sides by precipices, some extremely
deep and abrupt.”</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f77'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r77'>77</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is some confusion between the two Termessi, one of
which is apparently to the left of the road passing W. and N.W.
from Adalia. This we think was <i>Termessus Minor</i>—the <i>Almalu</i>
of Mr. Davis. The more important place, <i>Termessus Major</i> (on
its coins μείζων), was at the head of the pass described. These
views are confirmed by Eustath. and Dion. Perieg. v. 858,
Stephan. Byzant., and Hierocles. At a later period, the see of
Termessus had united with it the churches of two other places—Jovia
and Eudocia.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r78'>78</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cramer and some other geographers place Cremna to <i>the N.</i>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f79'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r79'>79</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The description in Arundell, vol. ii. pp. 59, &amp;c., shows that
he had explored the same ruins forty years before Mr. Davis,
under the idea they were those of Selge, though, on his plate, he
adds the words, “Acropolis of Germe—Cremna.” Colonel
Leake, too, suggested that “Germe” was perhaps a corruption
of “Cremna.” Had Mr. Arundell reflected on an inscription
he himself copied there ... ΛΔΗ ... ΝΑΤΩΝ, he might have
seen that the last word could naturally be supplied as ΚΡΗΜΝΑΤΩΝ—“of
the people of Kremna.” Zosimus says the winding
path up to the fortress was called by the natives the <i>Snail</i>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>“From it,” he adds, “the country inclined rapidly
in its general formation to the valley of the Kestrus,
which must have been at least 5,000 feet below us....
Most of the buildings of the city lay to the
N.W. of our point of ascent. On the N.E. and N.
was an extensive open space cultivated, but with
many oak trees and with much underwood scattered
over it.” ... Zosimus (A.D. 425) relates the history
of the blockade of Kremna by a Roman army.
It had been occupied by Lydius, an Isaurian free-booter,
and his provisions falling short, he caused
a part of the plateau to be sowed with corn. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>great double gate is the only structure still standing,
and, as all the columns have fallen exactly in the same
direction, Mr. Davis reasonably conjectures they were
overthrown by a single shock of an earthquake.
Some well-paved streets are traceable, one 18 feet
wide, with tombs and corridors running along each
side. It is curious that a place so remarkable, physically,
is scarcely mentioned by ancient writers. Thus,
it is not noticed in the campaign of Alexander, who
must have passed under it, but it was taken by
Strabo’s contemporary, the Galatian Amyntas (xii.
569),<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c016'><sup>[80]</sup></a> and was still later, as we have stated, a Roman
colony with the title “Colonia Julia Augusta Cremna.”
Its name is obviously derived from κρημνός, an overhanging
precipice.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c016'><sup>[81]</sup></a> Kremna was a Christian bishopric,
but only one of its bishops, Theodorus, is recorded.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f81'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r81'>81</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Zosimus’s description is exactly to the point:—Κρήμναν

</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Sagalassus</span> was taken by Alexander, after a severe
conflict, the result being, says Arrian, that all the rest
of Pisidia submitted to his arms (i. 28). On the
other hand, Manlius contented himself with ravaging
the territory around it; thereby compelling the Sagalassians
to pay a heavy contribution both of
money and produce. Both Arrian and Livy bear
testimony to the warlike and independent character
of the mountaineers of this part of Asia Minor; while
Strabo adds that it passed over to the Romans,
as one of the towns of Amyntas, the tetrarch of
Lycaonia. Sagalassus is further noticed by Pliny and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Ptolemy, and, in Christian times, was a bishopric.
Some magnificent ruins, at a great height above the
plain, have been proved by Mr. Arundell to be those
of this place, as he found there an inscription reading
ΣΑΓΑΛΑΣΣΕΩΝ ΠΟΛΙΣ ΤΗΣ ΠΙΣΙΔΙΑΣ, “The
City of the Sagalassians of Pisidia.” The position of
the old town, as may be seen in one of the engravings
in Mr. Arundell’s second Journey, is exceedingly
picturesque; and we may feel sure Arrian is correct
in stating that Alexander encountered a stiff resistance
from its inhabitants ere he forced his way into the
town.</p>

<p class='c015'>The existing remains of Sagalassus are mostly
Roman, but there is one very old wall of polygonal
masonry. One of the principal ruins, with a portico
300 feet long by 27 feet wide, has probably
been a Christian church: there is, also, a singularly
perfect theatre. The ruins of the Christian
church exhibit a building of vast proportions, constructed
of huge blocks of marble, with Corinthian
columns two feet in diameter. A large cross is cut
deep into one of the blocks at the principal entrance.
Mr. Hamilton, who calls the modern village Allahsún,
says that “there is no other ruined city in Asia
Minor, the situation and extensive remains of which
are so striking, or so interesting, or which give so
perfect an idea of the magnificent combination of
temples, palaces, theatres, gymnasia, fountains, and
tombs which adorned the cities of the ancient world.”<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c016'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f82'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r82'>82</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hamilton adds—“To the south is a high, insulated, and
conical hill, agreeing with Arrian’s description of the Acropolis,
λόφος πρὸ τῆς πόλεως—a hill in front of the city.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>One other place in Pisidia we have yet to mention,
<span class='sc'>Selge</span>, of old one of its chief cities, yet,
strange to say, at present unidentified, or only so
doubtfully. Originally a colony from Lacedæmon,
Selge maintained throughout its whole history the
character of its founders, and, probably, owing to
better laws and government, soon surpassed all
the neighbouring towns in population and power,
Strabo believing that it once had as many as
20,000 inhabitants. Much of its success was due
to the security of its position, high among the mountains
and difficult of access. Hence, the Selgians
retained their personal freedom, and, though more
than once compelled to pay heavily and deservedly
for their own aggressions, were never dispossessed
of their town by actual conquest. Naturally, they
were constantly in conflict with their neighbours,
especially, with Telmessus and Pednelissus.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c016'><sup>[83]</sup></a> They
had, however, the sense to conciliate Alexander when
he passed through their country. In the war with
Pednelissus, it would seem that, aided by the then
most powerful chief of the neighbouring country,
Achæus compelled the Selgians to sue for peace, to
pay down 400 talents, to restore the prisoners they
had taken, and to give 300 talents more. Yet, in
an actual attack on the city he was repulsed with
heavy loss (Polyb. v. 72-77). The coins of Selge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>prove its existence till a late date. One would have
thought that such a place, would have left remains
behind it amply sufficient for its identification; yet
all we can say, certainly, of it is that it could not have
been far to the east or south-east of Sagalassus. From
Zosimus, we might be led to look for it <i>between</i> the
Cestius and Eurymedon, for Tribigildus, having crossed
the latter, found himself enclosed between it and the
Melas: and possibly, Fellows did discover it. “On
this promontory,” says he, “stood one of the finest
cities that probably ever existed, now presenting magnificent
wrecks of grandeur. I rode for at least three
miles through a part of the city, which was one pile of
temples, theatres, and buildings, vieing with each other
in splendour.... The material of the ruins, like those
near Alaysóon (Sagalassus) had suffered much from exposure
to the elements ... but the scale, the simple
grandeur, and the beauty of style bespoke its date to
be early Greek. The sculptured cornices frequently
contain groups of figures fighting, wearing helmets
and body armour, with shields and long spears.”
Unfortunately, Fellows did not find a single legible inscription,
but the remains are, very likely, what Beaufort
heard of at Alaya; viz., “extensive remains of an
ancient Greek city with many temples, about fifteen
hours’ distance (say 35 miles) to the northward.”<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c016'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Lastly, we must give an account of the Pisidian, or
more accurately, the Phrygian, Antioch, a town of
the highest interest to the Christian reader, from its
connection with St. Paul’s early labours. It is remarkable
that, 50 years ago, its position was not known,
though the ancient notices of it, carefully studied, seem
to point out, pretty clearly, where it ought to have
been found. Little is known of this Antioch in early
times, but it was, traditionally, a colony of Magnesia
on the Mæander. Afterwards, like almost all the
towns of Eastern and Central Asia Minor, it fell
under the rule of the Seleucidæ, and, on their overthrow,
was given by the Romans to Eumenes of
Pergamus as one of the rewards for his faithful
alliance. Subsequently, it was, for a while, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Amyntas the Lycaonian. At an early period of the
empire, Antioch was known as Cæsarea, and somewhat
later, according to Ulpian, its citizens enjoyed
the Jus Italicum, that is, the same privileges as
native Romans. At the time of St. Paul’s visit it
was the centre of a great commercial activity. According
to Strabo, Antioch was on the south side
of the mountain boundary of Phrygia and Pisidia
(p. 577), Philomelium, a Phrygian town, being exactly
to the north, the latter standing on level ground,
while Antioch stood on a small eminence.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c016'><sup>[85]</sup></a> It was
reserved for Mr. Arundell to show, almost certainly,
its true site,<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c016'><sup>[86]</sup></a> and his description is exceedingly
interesting. Almost his first discovery was a “long
and immense building, constructed with prodigious
stones, and standing south and west.” This was a
church, not improbably constructed on the site of the
Synagogue where St. Paul preached. “The remains
of the aqueduct,” he adds, “of which twenty-one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>arches are perfect, are the most splendid I ever
beheld, the stones without cement, of the same massy
dimensions as the wall.”</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f83'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r83'>83</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It should be noted here, that the finding gold or silver coins
at a place is not <i>alone</i> sufficient evidence for its name, though
such a discovery is a presumption in favour of it. Where, however,
a large number of small <i>copper</i> coins are found, the presumption
becomes very strong. Obviously, gold and silver coins may,
easily, pass from one site to another, simply as objects of commerce.</p>
</div>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f84'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r84'>84</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The neighbourhood of Selge produced, and produces, two
useful botanical substances; one, the balsam of styrax or
storax (liquid-amber orientalis), the juice of an umbrageous
tree like the plane. Krinos (περὶ Στύρακος, Athens, 1862—)
shows it has been correctly described by Aetius and Paulus
Ægineta in the 6th and 7th centuries. It is noticed, also, in the
Travels of the Russian Abbot of Tver, A.D. 1113-5. The
author of the “Periplus” states that, in his time, storax went,
as it does now, by way of the Red Sea to India. In India it is
called Rose Malloes (Rosa Mallas, Rosum Alloes, Rosmal),
perhaps from the Malay, Rasamala. This gum is extracted
now by the Yuruk Turkomans, and is still used in the churches
and mosques of S. Asia Minor for incense. One form of this
substance is <i>Resina Benzoe</i>—<i>Gum Benjamin</i>, or <i>Benzoin</i> (Ibn
Batuta’s Travels, A.D. 1325-49—who says it comes from Java,
and is called Java Frankincense or Camphor). The popular name
is a corruption of <i>Lubán Jáwi</i> into <i>Ban-jawi</i>, &amp;c. Crawfurd
thinks it the old Malabathrum. It is stated by Vasco da Gama
to be a product of Xarnuz (Siam).</p>

<p class='c017'>The other substance is <i>Rhizoma Iridis</i> (popularly Orris-root),
used of old for giving a sweet odour to unguents (see Theophrastus,
Dioskorides, and Pliny). The ancient arms of Florence were
a white lily or iris on a red shield. Orris-root was used as a perfume
in England in 1480 (Wardrobe Accounts of Edward IV.),
and, according to Gerarde, was grown here. In Tuscany it is
still grown under the name of <i>Giaggiolo</i>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f85'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r85'>85</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All geographers, even Colonel Leake, seem to have gone
astray here, in their interpretation of Strabo. Thus, D’Anville
placed Antioch at Ak-Shehr (12 or 13 miles to the N., on the
real site of Philomelium), and such, too, would seem to have
been the opinion of the Latin historians of the Crusades, and
even of Anna Comnena. In the Peutinger tables, a great road
is marked from Iconium to Side, with a branch to Antioch.
This is well explained, if the present <i>Yalobatch</i> represents
Antioch.</p>

in the actual text of his travels, he rather suggests a strong probability
than proves his discovery. He did not find any inscription
with the name of the town. His argument is, however,
a strong inference that no other place in that neighbourhood,
but Antioch, could have left such vast remains.</p>

<p class='c015'>A little further on he met with undoubted remains
of a Temple of Bacchus, with the thyrsus or Bacchic
emblem, and an inscription stating that one Calpurnius
was “High Priest for life to the most glorious god
<span class='sc'>Bacchus</span>.” Another building, Mr. Arundell thinks,
from the number of fluted columns, must have been a
portico, “or the Temple of Lunus, or of Men Arcæus,
whose worship was established at Antioch.”<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a> Le
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Quien, in his “Oriens Christianus,” enumerated
twenty-six bishops of Antioch. One of these, Methodius,
and six other metropolitans subscribed the
protest of the Eastern Church against the errors of
Calvin. Hamilton, subsequently, found at Antioch
an inscription reading ANTIOCHEAE CAESARE,
which proves the truth of Arundell’s inferences (i.
p. 474).</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f87'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r87'>87</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Strabo speaks of the worship of this deity (ἱεροσύνη τις Μηνὸς Ἀρκαίου)
at Antioch in olden times. It seems to have been
abolished for some time, but to have been revived in Roman
days, as coins exist with the god Lunus leaning on a column,
and the legend COL. MEN. ANTIOCH, or MENSIS. COL.
CAES. ANTIOCH.; and inscriptions exist with the name of
L. Flavius Paulus—who is termed CVRATORI ARCÆ
SANCTVARII. Strabo, a native of Amasia, states that
a god called Men Pharnaces was worshipped at Cabira. From
the coins we further learn, that the river at Antioch was
called Antihos or Anthos, with ANTIOCH. COL., and the type
of a woman reclining.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Cilicia</span> had but few towns of much importance, and
these chiefly on the coast or not far inland. Indeed,
when we have mentioned Tarsus, Soli, Mallus, and
Mopsuestia, we have noticed the principal places in
this province. Of these, <span class='sc'>Tarsus</span><a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c016'><sup>[88]</sup></a> alone calls for any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>lengthened description. Of the early history of this
city little is known, but a tradition, illustrated by one
of its coins, asserted that Sardanapalus was buried
there.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c016'><sup>[89]</sup></a> Its situation, however, led to its becoming
the capital of Cilicia, a position it long retained.
Tarsus stood on a rich and fertile plain on both sides
of the river Cydnus. Historically, it is first noticed
by Xenophon, as, in his day, a great and wealthy city,
under a Persian satrap named Syennesis, the unwise
ally of Cyrus the Younger. It remained under the
Persian rule till the time of Alexander the Great, who
nearly lost his life by imprudently bathing when too
hot in the Cydnus (Curt. iii. 5; Arrian, ii. 4). In later
days it was, generally, under the Seleucidæ, though, for
a brief period, subject to the second and third Ptolemy.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f88'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r88'>88</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We can see no reason for supposing Tarsus the “Tarshish”
of the Bible. It did not export the kind of produce entrusted
to the “ships of Tarshish,” while the notices of it in the
Bible (Gen. x. 4; 1 Chron. i. 7; Psalm lxxiv.; Isaiah lxvi. 19),
imply a town or territory in the far west, whence, only, some
of these products (as tin), so far as we know, were then obtainable.
Hence we find the Phœnicians sailing thither in “long
ships” (Ezek. xxvii. 12, xxviii. 13; Jerem. x. 9); while the
Roman writers, as Ovid (Met. xiv. 416), Silius Italicus (iii. 399),
and Claudian (Epist. iii. v. 14), evidently use the name Tartessus
as synonymous with “West.” On the whole, it is most likely
that Tartessus in Spain (considered loosely as a district rather
than as a town) represents the Biblical Tarshish, and that
“ships of Tarshish” is a term equivalent with “Indiamen.”</p>

of Syria) was in the cabinet of the late General C. R. Fox.
It was found, in 1848, in a leaden box, between Adana and
Tarsus, some twenty feet under the surface of the ground. It
has been engraved by Mr. Vaux, in his “Nineveh and Persepolis,”
4th ed. 1856, p. 62. As its type—the so-called tomb of
Sardanapalus—is found on other coins of Tarsus, as late as the
time of Gordian, it is certain this myth maintained its hold on the
popular mind for a long period. The story of the pageant of
Cleopatra (Plut. Vit. Antonii) shows that the Cydnus must, in
those days, have been navigable up to Tarsus, some eight or
nine miles from the sea.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Supporting the cause of Cæsar, the great Julius himself
paid Tarsus a visit, when the Tarsians changed the
name of their city to Juliopolis. Augustus made it a
“libera civitas.” Hence, St. Paul, her most illustrious
son, spoke truly, when he said it was “no mean city,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>and urged with equal truth and justice that he was
“free-born,” while his judge had only obtained this
right “at a great price.” The fact is, its position on
the immediate confines of Syria and of Mesopotamia
was of the highest importance to the Romans in their
conflict with the Parthians and Persians. It still
retains its old name, slightly modified into Tarsous,
and is still the chief city of this part of Karamania.</p>

<p class='c015'>Tarsus<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c016'><sup>[90]</sup></a> was famous in early days for a remarkable
class of coins, known as Satrap-money. Among
these are coins of Tiribazus, Pharnabazus, Syennesis,
and of other rulers, between B.C. 410 and B.C. 370.
A description of a coin of Pharnabazus will show
their general character. On the obverse of this silver
piece is a bearded and helmeted head, possibly
the mythological type of Bellerophon or Perseus,
either of which would be appropriate to the Græco-Asiatic
population of Cilicia, and the name of Pharnabazus
in Phœnician letters. On the reverse, is a seated
representation of the Jupiter of Tarsus, with the
legend, <i>Baal-Tarz</i>, evidently the <i>Zeus Tersios</i> of the
Greeks, recorded on another coin as ΔΙΟΣ ΤΑΡΣΕΩΝ,
“Of the Jupiter of the Tarsians.” The Duc de
Luynes attributed this coin to the famous Pharnabazus
(B.C. 413-374), who, originally Satrap of the N.W.
district of Asia Minor, is memorable for the steady
resistance he made to the Greeks, while the ruler of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Lydia, Tissaphernes, on the other hand, accepted
Lacedæmonian gold. If so, this coin must have
been struck when Pharnabazus had given (B.C. 397, 8)
the command of the Persian fleet to the Athenian
Conon, as Tarsus was then the centre of the operations
against Cyprus. Another extremely rare coin
of Pharnabazus, with his name in Greek, was struck at
Lampsacus in Mysia, perhaps, for the payment of the
Greek mercenaries of Artaxerxes.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f90'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r90'>90</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Strabo has noted the studious habits of the Tarsians; no
other city, not even Athens and Alexandria, surpassing it in the
number and character of its schools. He adds, moreover, that
the learned seldom remained in the city, but, like St. Paul, migrated
elsewhere to complete their studies.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The towns along the coast of Cilicia have been
very carefully studied by Captain Beaufort, who has
identified many of them. The first of these, passing
from W. to E., was <span class='sc'>Coracesium</span>, a place historically
interesting as having been held for a long time by
Diodotus Tryphon, who, having revolted from Antiochus,
set the first example of active defiance to the
Seleucidæ; Coracesium was, also, the last place where
the pirates made a united resistance to the forces of
Pompey.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c016'><sup>[91]</sup></a> The whole story of these freebooters is
very interesting. It is clear that their successes were
mainly due to two things; first, the peculiar fitness
of their ports along the seashore of Cilicia for
prolonged resistance, with the high range of Taurus
to fall back on if over-pressed; and, secondly, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the internecine squabbles of the kings of Cyprus,
Egypt, and Syria with themselves and with the
Romans, which made it, from time to time, the interest
of each party to wink at their worst deeds.
The Sacred Island of Delos was their chief western
entrepôt; the increasing luxury of the Romans at the
same time giving ample encouragement to their traffic
in slaves.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f91'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r91'>91</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Anchiale</i>, which Colonel Leake thought the fort of Tarsus,
like that city, claimed Sardanapalus as its founder. The legend
was that Sardanapalus, the son of Anakyndaraxes, erected, in
one day, the cities of Anchiale and Tarsus. No one, nowadays,
accepts the verses given by Strabo, relating to this Sardanapalus
and his deeds, as genuine, and Aristotle says the sentiments in
them are fitter for the grave of an ox than for the tomb of a
king (Cic. Tusc. Disput. v. 35). An early writer, Amyntas,
records what recent research has shown to be probably the
truth, viz. that Sardanapalus was buried at Nineveh.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c015'>The promontory of Alaya, identified by Captain
Beaufort with Coracesium, rises, he says, abruptly
“from a low, sandy isthmus which is separated from
the mountains by a broad plain; two of its sides are
cliffs of great height, and absolutely perpendicular, indeed
the eastern side, on which the town is placed, is
so steep that the houses seem to rest on each other.”
Other places along this coast eastwards are, <span class='sc'>Laertes</span>
(the birthplace of Diogenes Laertius), ἐπὶ λόφου μαστοειδοῦς,
“on a hill, in form like a woman’s breast,”
and <span class='sc'>Selinus</span>, a river and a town (now Selinty), the
first of which is mentioned by Strabo, and the second
by Livy. Its later name of Trajanopolis it owed to
the sudden death there of the Emperor Trajan (A.D.
117), but, at a later period, the old name was revived
in connection with an episcopal church (Hierocles).
Beaufort speaks of its magnificent cliffs—“On the
highest point of these,” he says, “are the ruins of a
castle which commands the ascent of the hill in every
direction, and looks perpendicularly down on the sea.”
He notices also several other large structures, and,
among these, a mausoleum (perhaps that of Trajan),
an agora, a theatre, and an aqueduct. The supposed
mausoleum, 70 feet long and 50 feet wide, is constructed
of large well-cut blocks of stone and contains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>only one vault. Cyprus, distant sixty-five miles, can
be clearly seen from this headland.</p>

<p class='c015'>The next important seaport was <span class='sc'>Anemurium</span> (now
<i>Anamur</i>), in the neighbourhood of which Beaufort
discovered a perfect city of tombs. “These tombs,”
says he, “are small buildings detached from each
other and mostly of the same size, though varying
in their proportions; the roofs are arched, and the
exterior of the walls is dashed with a composition
of plaster and small particles of burnt red brick.
Each tomb consists of two chambers: the inner one
is subdivided into cells or receptacles for the bodies,
and the outer apartment is supplied with small recesses
and shelves, as if for the purpose of depositing
the funereal offerings, or the urns that contained the
ashes. The castle strongly resembles some of the
ancient castles of Great Britain. Its keep or citadel
is placed on a small rocky eminence, and commands
two open courts.... The extreme dimensions
are about 800 feet by 300 feet.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Celenderis</span> (now <i>Chelindreh</i>) was noted in ancient
history as the place which Piso, the enemy of Germanicus,
attempted to take (Tacit. An. xi. 80), and appears,
also, in the Ecclesiastical annals, as one of the episcopal
towns of Isauria. As the nearest point of communication
with Cyprus, it is still occupied by a small
population. There are some remains of a fortress which
Tacitus describes as of great strength; while many
arched vaults, sepulchres and sarkophagi may be seen
on the spot. All along this part of the coast of Cilicia
the presence of the Crusaders is clearly shown in the
names of existing places, as, for instance, in <i>Cavalière</i>
and <i>Provençal Island</i>; indeed, Vertot records that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>during the settlement of the Christian knights at
Rhodes, they took possession of several islands and
castles along the shores of Asia Minor. Another place,
some eight or nine miles inland, <span class='sc'>Selefkeh</span>, the ancient
<span class='sc'>Seleuceia ad Calycadnum</span>, is also specially
noticed by De Jauna in his History of Armenia, as
given by the king of Armenia to the knights of
Rhodes for their services. This town, which owed
its real or supposed origin to Seleukus Nicator,
was famous for its schools of literature and philosophy:
Athenæus and Xenarchus, two well-known Peripatetics,
having been born there. Seleucia was still
in existence in the time of Ammianus, and the ecclesiastical
historians, Socrates and Sozomen, speak of
Councils having been held here.</p>

<p class='c015'>Beaufort reports the existence at Selefkeh of many
ruins on the west side of the river, and, especially, of
an enormous reservoir lined with hard cement (the
“<i>opus Signinum</i>” or “<i>Coccio pesto</i>” of the Roman
aqueducts). This structure is 150 feet long by 75
feet broad and 35 feet deep, and could, therefore,
have held nearly 10,000 tons of water. A little
further on is a place called <i>Korghoz</i>, possibly, the
<span class='sc'>Corycus</span> of antiquity, and the site of the Corycian
cave, in mythology, the fabled abode of the giant,
Typhôs;<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c016'><sup>[92]</sup></a> but, more probably, the crater of an extinct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>volcano. Strabo says it was a deep and broad
circular valley, the lower part rugged, but covered
with shrubs and evergreens, and, especially, with
saffron, which was abundant here. From an internal
cavity gushed forth a copious stream, which,
for a while lost, after a brief course, reappeared near
the sea, which it joined. This was called the “bitter
water.” Beaufort found two places bearing the name
of Korgho Kalaler (castles), there being many signs
in the neighbourhood of the former existence of a
city of considerable size:—“A mole of great unhewn
rocks projects at one angle from the fortress about
100 yards across the bay, terminated by a solid
building twenty feet square.”<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c016'><sup>[93]</sup></a> Can this be the remains
of an ancient <i>pharos</i> or lighthouse? We should
add that the places, hitherto described, belong to what
was usually called Cilicia Tracheia; those we shall
now notice, belonging, on the other hand, to the plain
country.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Of these we take first, <span class='sc'>Soli</span>, a colony (Strabo tells
us) from Lindus, a relationship the Solians did not
forget during subsequent negotiations with the Romans.
Soli is first mentioned in Xenophon’s Anabasis,
and must, in the following seventy years, have
rapidly increased, as Alexander the Great fined the
people 200 talents for their attachment to the Persian
empire. After having been destroyed by Tigranes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Pompey placed there some of the Cilician pirates
whom he had spared; at the same time changing the
name of the city to Pompeiopolis. Most of the
existing remains are, therefore, Roman. “The first
object,” says Beaufort, “which presented itself on
landing was a beautiful harbour or basin, with parallel
sides and circular ends; it is entirely artificial, being
formed by surrounding moles or walls fifty feet in
thickness and seven feet in height.... Opposite
to the entrance of the harbour a portico rises from the
surrounding quay, and opens to a double row of two
hundred columns which, crossing the town, communicates
with the principal gate towards the country;
and from the outside of that gate a paved road continues,
in the same line, to a bridge over a small
river.... Even in its present state of wreck, the
effect of the whole is so imposing, that the most illiterate
seaman in the ship could not behold it without
emotion.” The actual execution of these columns is,
however, poor; and, of the original two hundred, only
forty-four are now standing.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c016'><sup>[94]</sup></a> Soli was the birthplace
of Chrysippus, Philemon, and Aratus.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f94'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r94'>94</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It has been said that the term σολοικσμος—<i>solœcismus</i>—<i>solecism</i>—meaning
ungrammatical speech—was derived from the
people of Soli; but this accusation is not certain (Cf. Strab. xiv.
671; Eustath. ad Dion. Perieg. v. 875; Suidas in voce Σόλοι).
There was another Soli in Cyprus, the inhabitants of which were
usually termed Solii (Σόλιοι), to distinguish them from those on
the mainland, who were termed Σολεῖς. Both, probably, spoke
but indifferent Greek.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Adana</span>, which is noticed first in the Mithradatic
War, by Appian, and, subsequently, by Pliny, Ptolemy,
Dio Cassius, Procopius, and the Byzantine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>historians, like Tarsus, adopted the name of Hadrian.
It is still a place of some size, and the capital of
the Pashalik of the same name.</p>

<p class='c015'>Near the mouth of the river <i>Pyramus</i> (now <i>Gihoon</i>),
and further up, are three towns which may be taken
together. The first is <span class='sc'>Mallus</span>, very near the sea, on the
left bank of the river over which Alexander threw a
bridge, in Mallotis, Strabo’s name for the circumjacent
district; or Megarsus (possibly an earlier name for
Mallus,) described in Lycophon as standing on a
“sea-worn hill”—an expression Beaufort says accurately
applies to a place now called <i>Karadash</i>.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c016'><sup>[95]</sup></a>
Mallus retained its name, slightly modified to Malo,
till mediæval times (Sanut. Secret. Fid. li. p. iv. c. 26):
2ndly, above Mallus, <span class='sc'>Mopsuestia</span>, the creation of a
certain mythical hero called Mopsus. According to
Pliny, this town was a “free” city, and Procopius states
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>that Justinian repaired the bridge over it (Ædif. v. 5).
During the Byzantine period the name was modified
to <i>Mensis</i>. Still further up the same river was
<span class='sc'>Anazarba</span> (sometimes called <i>Cæsarea ad Anazarbum</i>),
the capital, in the fifth century, of Eastern Cilicia
as Tarsus was of the Western—(Hierocles). It
was nearly destroyed by earthquakes in the reigns of
Justin and Justinian (Procop. Hist. Arcana, c. 18;
Cedren., p. 299). Dioskorides and Oppian were born
there. The last place in Cilicia to which we shall call
attention is <span class='sc'>Issus</span>, ever memorable as the scene of the
famous conflict between Alexander and Darius. Its
modern name, Scandaroon or Alexandretta, is obviously
derived from Alexandreia. The town stood
at the foot of the main chain of Mount Amanus, and,
at the head of the gulf to which it gave its name. It
was early (as might have been expected from its position)
a considerable town, but, in Strabo’s time, had
ceased to be more than a small port. Cicero, in his
expedition against the mountaineers in the neighbourhood
stayed there for some time (Epist. ad Attic.
v. 20). The famous defile leading from Cilicia into
Syria was to the east of the town.</p>

<p class='c017'>It has been disputed whether Megarsus was really on the river,
but the legend on its coins—ΜΕΓΑΡΣΕΩΝ ΠΡΟΣ ΤΩ ΠΥΡΑΜΩ—sets
<i>this</i> question at rest. The Aleian plain, which lay between
Tarsus and Mallus, was the traditional scene of Bellerophon’s
disaster (Il. z. 200).</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Having</span> now spoken of some of the principal places
in the west and south of Asia Minor, it will, we think,
be convenient to take next those towards its centre, in
<i>Cappadocia</i>, <i>Phrygia</i>, and <i>Galatia</i>. We must, however,
notice, first, the two small districts of <i>Lycaonia</i> and
<i>Isauria</i>, which are really portions cut out of the larger
adjoining provinces. Isauria will not detain us long,
as there is little in it that can be called Greek. It
was, as it has ever been, a wild mountain district,
with a population unsubdued till about the time of
Constantine; and, even after that, if the Byzantine
writers are worthy of credit, whole armies of Constantinopolitan
Greeks melted as snow in conflict with
these robber tribes. Ancient authors knew little of
Isauria except its northern part, all to the south,
with its capital, <span class='sc'>Isaura</span>, being to them, practically,
a <i>terra incognita</i>. As marauders, however,
the Isaurians were so troublesome to their neighbours,
that the Roman Senate sent a considerable
force against them, in B.C. 73, under P. Servilius,
whose success won for him the title of “Isauricus.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>This conquest, however, so to call it, was but
temporary, and, not long after, Amyntas of Lycaonia
lost his life in an attempt to crush one of their tribes.
In later days, one of their chieftains, Trebellianus,
claimed for himself the rank of Emperor, and struck
coins; and the Isaurians boasted, also, of one genuine
Emperor, Zeno Isauricus, A.D. 474-491.</p>
<p class='c015'>Of its chief town, <span class='sc'>Isaura</span>, we have coins of the
time of Geta and Elagabalus bearing the title of
ΜΗΤΡΟΠΟΛΕΩΣ ΙΣΑΥΡΩΝ. Mr. Hamilton has satisfactorily
identified its site on the line of road
between Iconium and Anemurium—a determination
in agreement with Pliny’s statement (v. 27), that the
province of Isauria stretched to the sea in that direction:
he adds that the tradition of their ancient
robber propensities is still remembered by the existing
peasantry of the district, though, considering
what this country has undergone during the
last fifteen hundred years, any such tradition is not
worth much. Mr. Hamilton found the ruins of the capital
on one of the loftiest ridges between the Taurus and
the plains of Konieh (Iconium) at an elevation of quite
5,000 feet above the sea, the wild and inaccessible
district around it offering, as he observes, “little or
no temptation to the rapacity of its neighbours.” An
inscription found on the spot fully confirmed his previous
surmises: it was on a triumphal arch, in honour
of the Emperor Hadrian, and, on the ground near it, was
a marble globe, a common emblem of Imperial power
“I afterwards,” says he, “found several other inscriptions
in this part of the town; of these, No. 432,
lying near the <i>agora</i>, is full of interest, as alluding to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>several buildings formerly erected in its neighbourhood.”
Strabo had remarked (xii. p. 569) that Amyntas
died before he had completed the town wall, and this
Hamilton found to be literally true, everything around
indicating a town entirely rebuilt, the wall itself, its
octagonal towers, temples, and triumphal arches
being constructed in the same peculiar style. “There
is,” says he, “an air of newness in its very ruins, as if
it had been destroyed before it was half built, although
it must not be forgotten that it flourished for many
centuries after the death of Augustus.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In Lycaonia there were few towns of importance,
except <span class='sc'>Iconium</span>, <span class='sc'>Laodicea</span>, <span class='sc'>Derbe</span>, and <span class='sc'>Lystra</span>, the
geological features of the country being unfavourable
to the existence of a large population. Travellers
who have seen both compare Lycaonia with the interior
of Australia. Both were, by nature, extensive
sheep-walks (thus, Amyntas had as many as 300
flocks of sheep); while both, alike, had much of arid
and salt desert, fitted only for camels. The central
plain of Lycaonia, from Kiepert’s map, seems the
largest in Asia Minor, and resembles the <i>steppes</i> of
Central Asia and of southern Russia. Ainsworth
tells how his camels browsed off the tops of the
<i>Mesembryanthemum</i> and <i>Salicornia</i>, reminding them,
as these, doubtless, did, of plains more familiar to
them than those of Asia Minor. Strabo made Isauria
part of Lycaonia.</p>

<p class='c015'>The principal town of Lycaonia, <span class='sc'>Iconium</span>, is mentioned
first by Xenophon, who considered it the most
eastern one of Phrygia, at one day’s journey, according
to Cicero, from Philomelium (Ak-shehr). Its position,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>amid many small streams, which exhaust themselves
in watering its gardens, and as the meeting-place of
several of the most important of the Roman roads
through Asia Minor, made it, from the first, an
important <i>entrepôt</i>; and, though Strabo calls it
πολίχνιον (a little town), the account of Pliny, and
the narrative in the Acts of the Apostles, prove it
was a large and populous place in the middle of the
first century A.D. Indeed, in Pliny’s time, its
territory embraced fourteen towns, stretched around
the capital (v. 27). Cicero was there for several days
previously to his Cilician campaign. Iconium will
always be invested with much interest owing to St.
Paul’s visits to it; the first of which was immediately
after his expulsion from Antioch in Pisidia, when the
Apostles “shook off the dust of their feet.” Messrs.
Conybeare and Howson have well remarked, that the
vast plain and the distant mountains are the most interesting
features of modern <i>Konieh</i>; for these, probably,
remain as they were in the first century of Christianity,
while the town has been repeatedly destroyed and
rebuilt. Little, indeed, remains of Greek or Roman
Iconium, except the inscriptions and fragments of
sculptures built into the Turkish walls.</p>

<p class='c015'>Iconium was famous in the early Middle Ages as the
capital of the Seljuk Sultans,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c016'><sup>[96]</sup></a> but was taken by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Emperor Barbarossa, during the second Crusade, in
his famous but futile attempt to force his way through
Asia Minor. To quote the picturesque words of
Gibbon, “Forty campaigns in Germany and Italy had
taught Barbarossa to command; and his soldiers, even
the princes of the empire, were accustomed under
his reign to obey. As soon as he had lost sight
of Philadelphia and Laodicea, the last cities of the
Greek frontier, he plunged into the salt and barren
desert, a land (says the historian) of horror and tribulation.
During twenty days every step of his fainting
and sickly march was besieged by innumerable hordes
of Turkmans, whose numbers and fury seemed after
each defeat to multiply and to inflame. The emperor
continued to struggle and to suffer; and such was the
measure of his calamities, that when he reached the
gates of Iconium no more than 1,000 knights were
able to serve on horseback. By a sudden and resolute
assault he defeated the guards and stormed the
capital of the sultan, who sued for pardon and peace.
The road was now open, and Frederic advanced in a
career of triumph, till he was unfortunately drowned
in a petty torrent of Cilicia.”<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c016'><sup>[97]</sup></a> Leake points out that
its walls, still between two or three miles round, are
full of inscriptions and of other ancient remains,
which the Seljuks seem to have tried to preserve.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r96'>96</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Seljuks had first been at Nicæa; but, when the Crusaders
took that town, in A.D. 1099, they fell back on Iconium,
which they held, with the exception of the brief interval of its
capture by Barbarossa in 1189, till the irruption of the Mongols,
under Jinghis Khán, and of his grandson, Huláku, who
broke down their power completely. Konieh has been an integral
part of the Turkish empire ever since the days of Bayazíd.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f97'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r97'>97</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There has been much doubt in which “Cilician torrent”
Barbarossa was drowned. The name in the record is the
“Saleph,” which maybe a corruption of Selefkeh (Seleucia),
a name sometimes given to the Calycadnus, as a chief town on
it. There seems no reason for drowning him in the Cydnus, or
modern Kara-su.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>The position of <span class='sc'>Lystra</span> and <span class='sc'>Derbe</span> are still uncertain.
Of Derbe, we know that it was the residence
of a robber chief of Lycaonia, named Antipater,<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c016'><sup>[98]</sup></a> who
was ultimately subdued by Amyntas (Strabo, xii. p.
569), while Strabo and Stephanus Byzantinus placed
it on the borders of Isauria towards Cappadocia.
St. Luke, however, and Hierocles placed it as clearly
in Lycaonia. If Lystra and Derbe stood in St.
Luke’s order, Lystra would be the nearest to Iconium;
but, though mentioned in Pliny and Ptolemy, we have
no further hint as to its actual position. One of its
bishops was present at the Council of Chalcedon.
The interesting account in the Acts xiv. 6-21, of the
behaviour of the people of Lystra, when St. Paul
proved his Divine mission by the cure of the cripple,
must be fresh in the mind of every one. With regard
to the speculative identifications of the sites of
Lystra and Derbe, it is, perhaps, worth stating that S.E.
of Konieh is a remarkable isolated hill, the Karadagh
or Black mountain. Not far from this mountain, Leake
and Hamilton placed these two towns, the former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>twenty miles S.E. of Iconium, the latter at some remarkable
ruins around its base, called by the Turks
Bin-bir-kalis-seh, or the 1,001 churches. Mr. Hamilton
and Mr. Edward Falkener have both examined this
remarkable group of ruined churches, recording, as
they clearly do, some site peculiarly revered in early
Christian times. Mr. Falkener’s remarks on these
curious monuments are much to the point. “The
principal group,” says he, “of the Bin-bir-Kalisseh, lies
at the foot of Karadagh.... Perceiving ruins on
the slope of the mountain, I began to ascend, and,
on reaching them, perceived that they were churches,
and, looking upwards, descried others yet above me,
and climbing from one to the other, I at length gained
the summit, where I found two churches. On looking
down, I perceived churches on all sides of the mountain
scattered about in various positions.... There
are about two dozen in tolerable preservation, and
the remains of perhaps forty may be traced altogether....
The mountain must have been considered
sacred; all the ruins are of the Christian epoch,
and, with the exception of a huge palace, every
building is a church.” It appears from the Acts that,
besides the Greek, there was still extant a local
Lycaonian dialect, and this is what we should expect
from what we know in the cases of Caria, Lycia, and
Phrygia, respectively. There are, however, no certain
means, now, of determining what was its character, and
whether it was of Semitic or of Indo-European descent.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f98'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r98'>98</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cicero (ad Fam. xiii. 73) says he was treated with much
civility by the Lycaonian Antipater—a view of things not agreeable
to his correspondent Q. Philippus, who had been previously
proconsul of Asia Minor. Stephanus Byzantinus states that
Derbe was sometimes called “Delbia,” a word in the Lycaonian
dialect said to mean “juniper.” It is possible that two words of
much similarity have been confounded in the MSS., viz. λιμὴν,
a harbour or port, and λίμνη, a lake or marsh; and that the town
was really on the shores of one of the many internal lakes of
that part of Asia Minor. The position of Derbe near the lake
of <i>Ak Ghieul</i>, and its resemblance to Delbia, with the modern
name of <i>Divleh</i>, as suggested by Hamilton, tends to its identification
with Divleh.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Having dealt pretty fully with the provinces and
towns of Asia Minor to the west and south, with some
notice of those in Lycaonia, we propose now to notice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>the chief ones in <i>Phrygia</i> and <i>Galatia</i>, though we
have not space to weigh nicely the limits of each of
these districts, which were, indeed, till Roman times,
in a state of constant change. Rome, as we know,
thought fit to include under the name of Asia more
than one piece arbitrarily cut out of the older provinces;
Roman Asia being to the rest of Asia Minor
much what Portugal on maps was to Spain.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Phrygians themselves were, like the Mysians,
probably of Thracian origin, as the name Bryges, or
Briges, is found in Macedonia, and is, probably,
connected with the Celtic word “briga,” as in Artobriga.
We find also in the neighbouring province of
Bithynia a tribe called Bebryces. The Phrygians have
also been supposed to have some connection with
Armenia—a theory, however, mainly resting on their
legend of a primeval flood, and of the resting of an
ark on the mountains near Celænæ.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is certain that the people of this part of Asia
Minor were very much intermixed. Thus, the Trojans
and Mysians were almost certainly members of
the great Phrygian race; for Hecuba was a Phrygian
princess, and Hector a common Phrygian name. One
stream of immigrators may, therefore, have come from
Armenia into Europe, and have, thence, returned
somewhat later to Phrygia, the Phrygians, like the
Macedonians, being said to be unable to pronounce
the φ (ph), and saying Bilippus and Berenice, for
Philippus and Pherenice: in the army, too, of Xerxes,
the Armenians and Phrygians wear similar armour.
Recent researches by Baron Texier and Mr. Hamilton
have shown that the Phrygians had a peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>style of architecture, the former having discovered an
entire town carved out of the solid rock. Tombs,
too, occur, in construction resembling the lion gate of
Mycenæ; while there is also a legend of a Phrygian
Pelops in Argolis. Phrygian religious rites were widely
accepted by remote districts of the ancient world, the
goddess Cybele being strictly a Phrygian deity, and
the wild “orgies” of her worship essentially Asiatic.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of the towns of Phrygia we take first <span class='sc'>Apamea</span>, as
unquestionably one of the most important for its
varied history and for the many persons of note who
are linked with it. Its foundation is due to Antiochus
Soter, who named it after his mother Apama. According
to Strabo, it stood at the source of the river
Marsyas, which burst forth in the middle of the city,
and flowed thence into the Mæander; and, though this
description is not quite borne out by recent observations,
the identity of its size with the modern village
of Deenare or Denair, has been satisfactorily shown
by an inscription found by Mr. Arundell, reading—<span class='fss'>QUI.
APAMEAE. NEGOCIANTVR. H. C.</span> (hoc. curaverunt).
“The merchants frequenting Apamea have
taken care (to erect this monument).”<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c016'><sup>[99]</sup></a> Cicero, who
was appointed proconsul of Cilicia in B.C. 51, has
left us many interesting particulars about it in his
letters to his friends, as he was much there. At this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>place, too, he deposited one of the three copies of his
quæstor’s accounts, at the same time refusing to accept
for himself or to permit his soldiers to appropriate, any
of the booty taken from the enemy. In a letter to
Can. Sallustius, proquæstor, he adds: “I shall leave
the money at Laodicea ... in order to avoid the
hazard, both to self and the commonwealth, of conveying
it in specie.” While governing his province,
one of his friends requested him to procure some
panthers for him. This he did, and at his own expense,
remarking at the same time “that the beasts
made sad complaints against him, and resolved to
quit the country, since no snares were laid in his
province for any other creatures but themselves.”<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c016'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f99'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r99'>99</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Arundell (i. p. 192). He remarks further: “Apamea may
now be asserted to have been at <i>Deenare</i> with as much confidence
as that Ephesus or Sardis stood on the sites which still
preserve their names. Apamea stood, we should add, nearly,
though not quite, on the site of the ancient Celænæ. It suffered
so severely from earthquakes, that the Roman tribute due
from it was remitted, A.D. 53, for five years (Tacit. Ann. xii. 58).”</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f100'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r100'>100</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Arundell remarks the panthers are still (1834) occasionally
found in the neighbourhood of Smyrna.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='c001'>COIN OF APAMEA CIBOTUS.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>But, besides the classical history of Apamea,
which is well enough known, this place was accredited
with a tradition referring to the Ark, which,
though purely legendary, cannot be omitted here; the
more so as the story of the Ark resting after the Flood
on one of the heights near Apamea has been supposed
by some to have given that city the title of “Cibotus,”
or “Apamea of the Chest.”<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c016'><sup>[101]</sup></a> Indeed, Mount Ararat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>was placed by some on the confines of Phrygia. The
coin of Alexander Severus, of which we give a copy
above, is supposed to refer to this story. On the reverse
is the name of the people of Apamea, and, above,
a square structure resting on a rock, and surrounded
by water. In this box are two figures, male and
female, and in front the word ΝΩΕ (Noe). It is,
therefore, a fair presumption that the maker of the
medal did mean to represent Noah and wife. Two
other persons, also a man and a woman, stand in front
of the supposed ark. If, as we believe, the Scriptural
deluge took place in Babylonia, some features of its
story might easily have found their way to Phrygia;
while, independently of this, we know that, even in
the days of St. Paul, there were Jewish synagogues
in many of the great towns of Asia Minor. Moreover,
during the 150 years between St. Paul and
Alexander Severus, some, at least, of the more striking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>events recorded in the Bible must have become
popularly known.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f101'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r101'>101</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It ought to be added that the ancient name of Apamea, when
the capital of Phrygia, was Celænæ, and that, in Roman times,
though Laodicea Combusta was the residence of the proconsul,
it was considered, commercially, inferior only to Ephesus.
Laodicea was one of the towns privileged to strike those curious
silver coins known by the name of <i>Cistophori</i>. Though we do
not accept the Ark story as the origin of this name “Kibotus,”
we cannot say that we attach much, if any, weight to many other
derivations that have been proposed.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The next place we notice is <span class='sc'>Azani</span>, or <span class='sc'>Aezani</span> (for
both spellings occur), the latter, that of the coins of
the place, being the more preferable. It is certain that
the present Lord Ashburnham, in 1824, was the first to
determine where it stood, though this discovery has,
with some carelessness, been often attributed wrongly.
It is now called Tchandur Hissar, and, from Keppel,
Hamilton, and Fellows, appears to possess some ruins
of remarkable beauty, and more than one Roman
bridge. Hamilton (i. 101) states that its Ionic temple
(of which Fellows and Pullan give drawings) is one of
the most perfect in Asia Minor. Rather curiously, no
walls have been found; but the place has suffered
from plunderers severely, every tomb having been
despoiled.</p>

<p class='c015'>In <i>Phrygia Magna</i>, as distinguished from <i>Phrygia
Epictetus</i>, a place of early notice and of long importance
was <span class='sc'>Synnada</span>, which we hear of first in connection
with the famous march of Cn. Manlius against
the Gallo-Græci. Cicero visited it in his progress
towards Cilicia. In Pliny’s time, it was the judicial
centre of the neighbourhood. It was chiefly famous
for a beautiful marble with purple spots and veins,
to which Statius alludes (Silv. i. 5, 56). Texier was
the first to discover the actual quarries, which were,
as the natives of old asserted, not at Synnada, but at
Docimia; whence the marble itself was sometimes
called “Docimites lapis.” Paulus Silentiarius, in a
poem on the church of St. Sophia, has well described
its character. Docimia itself was probably at the end
of the plain where Synnada was itself situate. Hierocles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>makes Synnada a bishopric of Phrygia Salutaris.
Its ruins are now called <i>Eski Kara Hissar</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>On the main road from Synnada towards Iconium
stood <span class='sc'>Philomelium</span>, the “city of nightingales,” now,
since the discovery of the true site of the Pisidian
Antioch, identified with Ak-shehr. It was a place
of much value to the early Turkish rulers, and many
handsome Saracenic buildings may still be seen;
hence, too, it is often mentioned in the wars between
the Greek emperors and the Sultans of Iconium, as
in Procopius (Hist. Arc. 18) and Anna Comnena
(p. 473).<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c016'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f102'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r102'>102</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class='sc'>Philomelium</span>, now called <i>Afium Kara Hissar</i> (the “black
castle of opium”), has much interest as the centre of the great
Asia-Minor trade in that drug, the medicinal properties of which
were known to Theophrastus in the third century B.C., under
the name of μηκώνιον. Scribonius Largus (A.D. 40), also, knew
that the best form of it was procured from the capsules, and not
from the leaves of the poppy (Berthold, Argent. 1786, c. iii.
s. 2). Dioscorides, thirty years later, calls the juice of these capsules
ὀπός (Angl. <i>Sap</i>), and the cutting them ὀπίζειν. Hence,
the name, <i>Opium</i>. Pliny (iv. c. 65, xx. c. 76) points out the
medicinal use of “Opion,” and Celsus calls the extracted juice
“<i>Lacryma papaveris</i>.” Obviously, from this “Opion” comes
the Arabic “Afyum,” which is found in many Eastern languages,
and may have been spread all the more, owing to Muhammad’s
interdiction of the use of wine. In India, <i>Opium</i> is
noticed, first, in Barbosa’s Travels, A.D. 1511 (ap. Hakluyt),
who found it, at that time, in Malabar and Calicut. Neither
Chinese nor Sanskrit has a native word for this drug. <i>Opium
Thebaicum</i> is mentioned as early as A.D. 1288-96, by Simon
Januensis, Physician to Pope Nicholas IV. (Clavis Sanationis.
Venet. 1510); and Kæmpfer (1687) remarks that compounds of
opium, nutmegs, &amp;c., were largely sold in his time, as long
before, under the name of “<i>Theriaka</i>.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>But the most important place in the neighbourhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>was <span class='sc'>Laodicea</span>, often called “Combusta,” “the burnt,”
which is to be carefully distinguished from the other
town of the same name we shall presently describe in
connection with Hierapolis, and which is generally
called “ad Lycum,” “on the Lycus,” in the province
of Lydia. Recent geographers, however, give both
these towns to Phrygia. Laodicea Combusta was
about nine hours N.W. of Iconium, and under its
modern names of Yorgan Ladik or Ladik-el-Tchaus,
is famous throughout Asia Minor for its manufacture
of carpets. It has been, popularly, supposed, that it
derived its name from the existence at it of some
remarkable volcanic agencies. This, however, Mr.
Hamilton has clearly shown, is not the case. “There
is not,” he says, “a particle of volcanic or igneous
rock in the neighbourhood; the hills consist of blue
marble, and of the argillaceous and micaceous schists
with which that rock is usually associated.” He
thinks it may, at some time or other, have been burnt
down, and, on being rebuilt, have received this distinguishing
title. The inscriptions he found there,
though in great abundance, have little interest, being
chiefly funereal: they are all carved out of the dark
blue-veined limestone of the adjoining hills.</p>

<p class='c015'>The last three places in Phrygia, which we think it
necessary to note especially, we shall take together,
as situate near one another, and, historically, closely
connected. These cities are <span class='sc'>Hierapolis</span>, <span class='sc'>Laodicea</span>,
(ad Lycum), and <span class='sc'>Colossæ</span>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Hierapolis</span> is chiefly remarkable for waters so
loaded with petrifying materials as to have completely
changed, by their deposits, the face of the country
in the course of centuries; a result, noticed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>many ancient authors, as Vitruvius, Pausanias, &amp;c.
Chandler states that a cliff near the town is one
entire incrustation, and describes its appearance as
that of “an immense frozen cascade, the surface
wavy, as of water at once fixed, or in its headlong
course suddenly petrified.”<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c016'><sup>[103]</sup></a> An excellent view of this
curious scene is given in Mr. Davis’s “Anatolica,”
p. 100. Besides its remarkable petrifying power,
Strabo states also that the waters of Hierapolis were
famous for dyeing; and it is curious confirmation of
this statement, that an early English traveller (Dr.
Smith, in 1671) copied an inscription referring to a
“<i>company of dyers</i>” (ἡ ἐργασία τῶν βαφέων). The
position of Hierapolis must have been very imposing,
placed as it was on a high piece of ground, “200 paces
wide, and a mile in length.” Abundant ruins still
remain, consisting of the relics of three Christian
churches, one 300 feet long, and of a gymnasium, considered
by Leake to be one of the only three “which
are in a state of preservation sufficient to give any
useful information on the subject of these buildings,”
together with a prodigious number of fallen columns,
in the wildest state of confusion. It seems a pity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>that no efficient steps have been taken to excavate
thoroughly such a site as that of Hierapolis, where
monuments of much historical interest, possibly, too,
of surpassing excellence as sculpture, might reasonably
be anticipated. Hierapolis is specially noticed in
St. Paul’s epistle to the Colossians (iv. 13), which
shows clearly that, at that time, there were many converts
to Christianity, probably owing to the zeal of
Epaphras, who had been long a common labourer
with the Apostle. Somewhat later, Hierapolis appears
in Hierocles as the metropolis of Phrygia; and
Arundell gives a list of the bishops of the see
whose names have been preserved. The present
ruins are called <i>Pambouk Kalessi</i>.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f103'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r103'>103</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Hamilton says he could distinctly trace six different
cascades, each of which had left a separate incrustation. The
ancient city itself was built on a terrace entirely formed by this
or similar incrustations. He adds: “But if the appearance of
the encrusted cliff was curious when seen from below, it became
infinitely more so when we looked down upon it from the road,
and the detail of its structure became more apparent. The wavy
and undulating lines of solid matter which extend over the surface
look as if a large river had been suddenly arrested in its
course and converted into stone.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Laodicea</span> “<i>ad Lycum</i>” was, in the time of Strabo,
one of the principal places in this province, and the
centre of the Roman power in this part of Asia. Many
men of great wealth, it is said, contributed to its
early magnificence; Strabo noticing Hiero, who, besides
greatly embellishing it during his lifetime, left
to it by will the sum of 2,000 talents, together with
the orator Zeno, and his son Polemo, who was made
by Augustus king of part of Pontus. There are some
difficulties in reconciling the statements of ancient
authors about the rivers that flowed by or close to
this town, and even recent investigations have not
made this matter quite clear. Four rivers are mentioned
in connection with it—the Lycus, Asopus,
Caprus, and the Cadmus. Of these the first is, unquestionably,
the most important, as having given its
name to the town. It is likely these difficulties have
been increased by the earthquakes noticed by Strabo,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>who says that Laodicea, more than any other town,
was subject to their baneful influence. His words
are remarkable (εἰ γάρ τις ἄλλη καὶ ἡ Λαοδίκεια εὕσειστος,
Strab. p. 578). Such earthquakes would,
naturally modify the course of these streams.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c016'><sup>[104]</sup></a> Col.
Leake calls especial attention to the importance of a
thorough investigation of the ruins of all these great
towns: so much is still on the surface, that he thinks
there is reasonable hope of the discovery of much
still buried. The same, to a smaller extent, would,
probably, prove true of other cities in the vale of the
Mæander; for Strabo thought that Philadelphia,
Sardes, and Magnesia ad Sipylum were not less
than Laodicea, and had all alike suffered from the
ravages of earthquakes; and this view was completely
supported by Arundell from his own personal observations
at Laodicea (Seven Churches, p. 85).</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r104'>104</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Compare what Tacitus says, Annal. ii. 79, xiv. 97, and

town in Polyb. v. 57, 3; Cic. Verr. i. 3; Epist. ad Fam. iii.

<p class='c015'>Laodicea suffered severely at the hands of Mithradates,
but, with the reign of Augustus, its real fame
and prosperity arose and long continued. About A.D.
1097 it was seized by the Turks, and subsequently
was, alternately, in their hands or in those of the Byzantine
emperors. In 1190 the Emperor Barbarossa was
welcomed by the then inhabitants with much kindness,
but, shortly afterwards, it was wholly desolated by
the Turks. The zeal of St. Paul for the Church of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Laodicea suggests that there must early have been
abundant converts to the new faith in its neighbourhood.
It is, however, also clear that their allegiance
was not very trustworthy, and that they were much
inclined to accept a modified form of Christianity.
St. Paul’s words in his Epistle to the Colossians
(ii. 1) show this plainly enough—“For I would,” says
he, “that ye knew what great conflict I have for you,
and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have
not seen my face in the flesh.” Again, “When this
epistle is read among you, cause that it be read
also in the Church of the Laodiceans” (iv. 16).
The Book of Revelation contains, also, strong strictures
on the lukewarmness of the Laodiceans. “I
know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot;
I would thou wert cold or hot. So then, because
thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will
spue thee out of my mouth” (Rev. iii. 15, 16). Laodicea,
though sometimes called Ladik, is more usually
known as Eski-Hissar, the Turkish form of the
common Levantine title of Palæo-Castro—“Old
Castle.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Colossæ</span>, the last of the three towns, has been much
confused with the other two, from the haste and want
of accurate observation of different travellers. Much
time is, indeed, requisite for the comparison of the
brief notes of ancient authors with the existing facts.
It is not certain when Colossæ was founded, or to
what circumstances it owes its name, but it existed
some centuries before the Christian era, as it is mentioned
by Herodotus as a large and flourishing town
of Phrygia when Xerxes passed through it in B.C.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>481, on his way from Cappadocia to Sardes (vii. 30);
nor had it, apparently, at all decayed when visited by
Cyrus the Younger, about eighty years subsequently,
(Xen. Anab. i. 2). Like the people of the adjacent
Laodicea, the Colossians were great growers of wool.
It was nearly destroyed in the days of Nero, but it
survived, at all events, as the name of a Christian
bishopric, till the time of Hierocles’s <i>Synecdemus</i>.
Somewhat later, a new town named Chonas was built
there, the certain identification of its ruins being
mainly due to the fact that Nicetas the Annalist was
born there. St. Paul, as we know, wrote an epistle to
the Colossians, but his words, “Since we <i>heard</i> of
your faith in Christ Jesus,” seem to imply that he was
never there himself. On the other hand, Epaphras,
who was a native of Colossæ, and Onesimus, are
specially noted as having preached there.</p>

<p class='c015'>Colossæ has been repeatedly visited by travellers,
such as Dr. Smith, Picenini, Pococke, and
Arundell; but to Mr. Hamilton we owe the clearest
notice of it, and the reconciling of many points
not understood by those who preceded him. Herodotus,
as we have remarked, had stated that
there was a χάσμα γῆς (a deep chasm) at Colossæ,
and that the Lycus flowed by a subterranean channel
for half a mile. This chasm Mr. Hamilton traced,
proving how the Lycus may well have been <i>said</i> to
have flowed underground, owing to the great accumulation
of petrifying matter from the stream, now
called <i>Ak Sú</i>, or “White Water.” Mr. Hamilton
quotes, also, a passage from the Byzantine writer,
Curopalates, clearly referring to the same curious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>phenomenon. Pliny, too, makes an interesting remark
as to the quality of this water, where he says,
“There is a river at Colossæ which will convert
brick into stone.” Hamilton adds, “The Ak Sú,
which joins the Choruk in the centre of the town,
would soon cover a brick with a thick incrustation,
and even fill the porous interior with the same substance
by means of infiltration.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The only towns in Galatia we think worthy of any
especial note are <span class='sc'>Ancyra</span>, <span class='sc'>Pessinus</span>, and <span class='sc'>Tavium</span>—in
fact, Galatia, the land of the Asiatic Gauls,
was little more than a dismemberment of the ancient
Phrygia, mainly induced by the invasion of a
portion of the vast horde of Gauls, who, descending
from Pannonia under the second Brennus, B.C. 279,
were, ultimately, induced to cross the Hellespont, on
the invitation of Nicomedes I. of Pergamus. The
general history of Galatia is so well known, we need
not dwell on it here. Suffice it, that the three principal
tribes of these invaders were known as the Tectosages,
the Tolistoboii, and the Trocmi, and that, after many
battles, in which their power was greatly reduced,
they were settled, the first at Ancyra, the second at
Pessinus, and the third at Tavium. Some historical
facts connected with them, it may, however, be as
well to mention; viz., that Antiochus obtained the
name of Soter from the great defeat he inflicted on
them; and that, beaten by Attalus I. and Prusias,
they were most completely subdued by the consul
Manlius in A.D. 189. Gauls are found as mercenaries
in all the wars of the times, and, often,
fighting against one another, being even noticed as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>such in the Maccabees (1. viii. 2). So late as the
fourth century, St. Jerome, who had lived long at
Trèves, states that the common tongue of Galatia was
the same as that of that city. Curiously, only one
name, certainly Celtic, <i>Eccobriga</i>, between Tavium
and Ancyra, has been preserved in the Itineraries.
As a people, they greatly resembled the Gauls Cæsar
describes—“Natio est omnis Gallorum admodum
dedita superstitionibus”; hence, they adopted, at once,
the Phrygian worship of Cybele as “Mater Deorum,”—the
“Galli” of Pessinus being her special priests.
Their leading men, however, soon became wealthy,
and were speedily Hellenized.</p>

<p class='c015'>The most important place in Galatia was <span class='sc'>Ancyra</span>,
on the Sangarius; traditionally, the foundation of
Midas, the son of Gordius. The anchor he found
there, whence the city’s name, Pausanias says, was,
still, in his day, preserved in the Temple of Jupiter.
The territory round this city was formally created a
Roman province by Augustus, B.C. 25, the epithet
“Tectosagum” being added to its title “Sebaste,” to
distinguish it from Pessinus and Tavium, which bore,
also, the epithets of Sebaste or Augusta. On the coins
of Nero, Ancyra is, also, called Metropolis; and,
though much decayed, is still a considerable place,
with a large population.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c016'><sup>[105]</sup></a> In the adjacent plains
occurred the mighty conflict between Bayazíd and
Timúr (Tamerlane), in which the former lost his crown,
and was taken prisoner by the Moghul emperor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>though the popular legend of the “cage of Bayazíd”
is, probably, as little authentic as the burning of the
library of Alexandria by the orders of Omar.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f105'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r105'>105</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the Jerusalem and Antonine Itineraries we notice one
name, <i>Ipeto-brogea</i>, the latter portion of which is probably Celtic,
like Allo-<i>broges</i>, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>But the most interesting matter, in connection with
Ancyra is the famous Inscription of Augustus<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c016'><sup>[106]</sup></a> (sometimes
called his “Will”), generally known by scholars
under the title of the “Marmor Ancyranum.” What
was then visible of this Inscription was first copied by
Busbequius, about A.D. 1555, and published in 1579,
at Antwerp, by Andreas Schottus.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c016'><sup>[107]</sup></a> At first, the Latin
portion only was obtained, but, by degrees, portions of
the Greek have been recovered, an important addition
having been made by Mr. Hamilton.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c016'><sup>[108]</sup></a> A very complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>account of it has been recently published by
Theod. Mommsen, under the title “Res gestæ Divi
Augusti,” Berl. 1865, with very accurate copies of the
Greek legend, specially executed for Napoleon III.
by M. Perrot.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f106'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r106'>106</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The whole town of Ancyra swarms with inscriptions. Mr.
Hamilton says: “The collection of inscriptions made during my
stay at Ancyra was very numerous; many of them never before
published. They were met with in all parts of the town,—in
the gateways and courtyards of private houses, but, chiefly, on the
walls of the citadel.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f107'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r107'>107</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The original inscription was engraved at Rome on brazen
tablets in front of his Mausoleum (Sueton. Aug.), known in
Mediæval times under the name of <i>L’Austa</i>. From an inscription
in Boeckh, C. I. Gr. No. 4,039, we learn that the Ancyran
inscription was placed in the Σεβαστῆον (Augusteum), and on
one of the antæ of the Temple are the words—</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c022'>

<p class='c017'>This is probably the temple alluded to in the decree of Augustus,
and referred to by Josephus (Antiq. xvi. 6).</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f108'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r108'>108</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Too much credit cannot be given to Mr. Hamilton for his
successful labours in copying the greater part of the Greek
version, which in many instances supplies defects in the Latin
version. “I entered,” says he, “into a negotiation with the
proprietor of the house ... (abutting on the Temple).... In
the course of two days I had the satisfaction of finding that he
had agreed to my proposal. I had hardly dared to hope that
the Mahometan would have allowed a Ghiaour to take down
the wall of his house for such a purpose.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>It would be impossible to give here even the
briefest summary of this very interesting and valuable
inscription, which fully deserves the most careful
perusal; but we may mention that, among the historical
events Augustus records, are his crushing the
murderers of Julius Cæsar, when he was only 21,—the
titles conferred on him—the census of his people—the
closing of the Temple of Janus—his great
largesses to the people, agreeably with the will of
Julius Cæsar—with a remarkable list of the monumental
works begun or completed by him in Rome<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c016'><sup>[109]</sup></a>—a
notice of the highest value to Roman antiquaries,
and, therefore, very properly given by Mr. Parker
in his recent volume on the “Forum Romanum.”
He then recounts his crushing the pirates, noticing
also the Servile war; the effect of the battle of Actium
on Italy; the boundaries of the provinces then subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>to him, and the extension of the Roman arms
to Æthiopia and Arabia; the submission of Tiridates
and Phraates, the kings of Parthia; and of Dubnovelaunus,
king of the Britons. He concludes by
saying, “When I wrote this I was in my seventy-sixth
year,” and very shortly after this he died.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c016'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The next town of Galatia we notice, <span class='sc'>Pessinus</span>,
was situate near the left bank of the Sangarius, on
the road to Angora. It was the capital of the Gallic
tribe of the Tolistoboii, and celebrated in antiquity
for its worship of the goddess Rhea, or Cybele. The
story went that the original shrine of this goddess was
removed to Rome, towards the close of the second
Punic war, the safety of Italy being said to depend on
this step. It is clear that the people of Pessinus did not
care much about their most sacred shrine—possibly,
however, as King Attalus supported the Roman demand,
they could not help themselves. It is worthy of
note, that, not long after the removal of this shrine, the
Galli became the chief priests of the worship of Cybele,
and, as such, went out to propitiate Manlius, when
about to throw a bridge over the Sangarius (Livy,
xxxviii. 18). Polybius gives the names of these
priests (Polyb. Fragm. 4). Coins of Pessinus exhibit
the worship of Cybele as late as Caracalla, and we
know that Julian the Apostate visited her temple
(Ammian. xxii. 9). One name she bore was that of
Agdistis, Pessinus itself being seated under this
mountain, which was also called Dindymus. M. Texier
seems to have first recognized its ruins at a place now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>called Sevrihissar, of which an excellent account is
given by Mr. Hamilton (i. p. 438). “Every step we
advanced,” says he, “gave evidence of the importance
and magnificence of the public buildings with which
this site must once have been adorned.” We may add
that Mr. Hamilton’s further researches enabled him
to reconcile the conflicting accounts of the march of
Manlius in Polybius and Livy, the whole of the course
of the Roman general being, now, fairly traceable.</p>

<p class='c015'>The last of these Galatian towns, <span class='sc'>Tavium</span>, was the
abode of the third Gallic tribe, the Trocmi, as is shown
by an inscription on a coin, reading ΤΑΟΥΙΑΝΩΝ ΤΡΟ.
The position of this town has been identified by
Mr. Hamilton as that where M. Texier found some
very remarkable sculptures, which he, erroneously,
called Pterium, the site of one of the battles between
Crœsus and Cyrus. It is more probable that
this place was much nearer the shores of the Black
Sea. If Hamilton is right, Boghaz-kieui marks the
site of the old town, which was one of great trade,
and famous for a colossal bronze statue and temple
of Jupiter. The careful measurement of the seven
great roads, recorded as having met at Tavium,
agrees, too, with his view. The bas-reliefs discovered
by M. Texier, about two miles from this temple, are
among the most curious in Asia Minor. Mr. Hamilton
gives a view of them (vol. i. p. 394), whence we
are inclined to think that they must be of Persian
origin. So far as we can judge from the engraving,
the work resembles much that at Behistan; moreover,
two of the figures seem to be standing on lions or
panthers, as on the reliefs found by Mr. Layard at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Bavian, and to be seen, also, of some of the coins of
Tarsus. The subject appears to be the meeting of
two kings, the principal figures being five feet high.
Two of the figures stand on a kind of double-headed
eagle. Mr. Hamilton suggested a resemblance between
them and those at Persepolis, an appreciation
the more remarkable that when Mr. Hamilton’s work
was published in 1842, none of the Assyrian excavations
had been begun. Considering the great influence
of the Persians after the establishment of the
empire of Darius, the son of Hystaspes, there is no
improbability in the carving being the work of some
powerful satrap, like Pharnabazus, who might easily
have been familiar with the sculptures at Bavian,
Behistan, and Persepolis.</p>

<p class='c015'>Over the towns in the remaining provinces of Asia
Minor, <i>Cappadocia</i>, <i>Pontus</i>, <i>Paphlagonia</i>, and <i>Bithynia</i>,
it will not be necessary for us to linger at any
length; not because there are not abundant objects
of interest in each of them, but that the remains,
purely Greek, are comparatively few, while the space
we can give for an adequate description of them is
exceedingly limited. We shall, however, notice some
of the chief places, either of Greek origin, or directly
connected with the Greeks, referring to the journals
of the travellers we have so often quoted; and especially
to Mr. Hamilton, for a more full and detailed
account of them.</p>

<p class='c015'>To take first <i>Cappadocia</i>, which is in this sense
peculiar, that it was for centuries governed, first by
satraps claiming descent from one of the seven
conspirators who aided Darius, and, secondly, by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>native race of kings, till it became a Roman province.
The great plains of Cappadocia, at an altitude seldom
less than 4,000 feet above the sea, were famous for
the breed of horses they raised; corn, too, and many
excellent fruits found in this province their native
home. Salt, and various kinds of crystal, were also
largely exported from Cappadocia.</p>

<p class='c015'>Of the towns of Cappadocia, we may mention
<span class='sc'>Nazianzus</span>, a site celebrated as the birthplace of its
famous bishop, Gregory, a great ecclesiastical writer,
a wit and a poet (see his humorous description of
Sasina, the church to which he was first appointed,
Orat. xxv. p. 435, which we wish we had space to
quote). Its ancient position has been accurately determined
by the observations of more than one modern
traveller (Hamilton, ii. p. 228). <i>Mazaca</i>, afterwards
called <span class='sc'>Cæsarea</span> <i>ad Argæum</i>, was for many centuries
the capital of Cappadocia, and is still a place of
some importance. The chief feature of its scenery
was the Mons Argæus (now Erjish Dagh), reputed
the loftiest mountain of Asia Minor, which rises immediately
above it, covered with perpetual snow. The
town itself, though ultimately the capital, appears
to have been for a long time little more than a
camp; indeed, Horace’s description probably tells us
all that “His Majesty” of Cappadocia really required:
“Mancipiis locuples, eget æris Cappadocum
rex” (“Though rich in slaves, the king of Cappadocia
lacks ready money”), (Ep. i. 6, 39). Cappadocian
slaves were abundant in Rome, and had a high reputation
as bakers and confectioners (Plut. Lucull.
Athen. i. 20, &amp;c.). One of the most memorable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>events of the history of the town was, its long and
gallant resistance to the Sassanian emperor, in the
war between Valerian and Sapor. In Christian times,
it derived much fame from the fact that St. Basil was
born there, and was, subsequently, for many years its
bishop (Socrat. H. E. v. 8; Hierocl. p. 698). Mr.
Hamilton (ii. pp. 274-281) gives an interesting account
of his ascent of the great mountain near it [the
height of which he found to be about 13,000 feet], a
feat, we believe, he was the first to accomplish.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Tyana</span>, another Cappadocian town, is chiefly noted
as the birthplace of Apollonius of Tyana, whose
amusing life has been preserved by Philostratus.
From its position on the defiles leading through
Taurus into Cilicia, it must have been a place of
some importance; and hence, probably, the tradition
that it was built by Semiramis (Strab. xii. 537). In
later times it was the seat of a Christian bishopric
(Greg. Naz. Epist. 33). Hamilton thinks that a place
called <i>Iftyan Kas</i> may mark this site. There is near
to it the remains of a fine aqueduct, ascribed by the
natives to Nimrod, but, really, of Roman origin.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Comana</span>, the only other place in Cappadocia, which
it is necessary to notice, was really the chief town of
a subdistrict called Cataonia. It was chiefly celebrated
for its collection of priests, soothsayers, and
the like, who were devoted to the worship of Mâ (the
Moon), or, as some say, the Cappadocian Bellona.
Strabo asserts that the votaries of this sacred institution
amounted to as many as 6,000 persons, of both
sexes (xii. 535). Some, on the other hand, think this
goddess the Anaitis of the Persians, the Agdistis or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Cybele of the Phrygians. Coins of Comana, of Antoninus
Pius, show that there was a Roman colony there,
which was in existence as late as Caracalla.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Pontus</i>, a narrow slip along the shores of the
Black Sea, was chiefly memorable for its great fertility
in the fruits now so common in our western
lands, as cherries (perhaps so named from one of
its towns, Cerasus), peaches, almonds, &amp;c. It was
also very rich in grain, timber, honey, and wax;
while its mineral wealth is strikingly shown by the
fact that one of its tribes, the Chalybes, famous so
early as the time of Xenophon for their skill in
working iron, gave their name to the Greek word for
hardened iron or steel.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c016'><sup>[111]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Trapezus</span> (now Trebisonde),
its only considerable town, was in ancient
days believed to be a colony of Sinope, the foundress
of several other places along the coasts of
the Black Sea. It was evidently a city of note
when Xenophon came there, in B.C. 400, with the
remains of the Ten Thousand, as its citizens hospitably
entertained the Greek host under his command.
We find it, also, in much prosperity when
Arrian was governor of Pontus, under Hadrian.
In later days, Trapezus was the capital of a petty
empire under a branch of the princely house of the
Comneni, its rulers assuming the pompous title of
Emperors of Trebizonde, and claiming, though not
always securing, independence of the Greek Empire.
It is still a place of commercial importance.
We may add that it was not far from this place, near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>the town of Zela, that Cæsar defeated the troops of
the despicable traitor Pharnaces so quickly, that he
announced his victory in the famous words, “Veni,
Vidi, Vici” (“I came, I saw, I conquered”) (Hist.
Bell. Alex. c. 72; Plut. Vit. Cæs.; Sueton. Cæs. c. 37).
The history of Pontus is closely interwoven with that
of the famous Mithradates; but, into this, we have
not the space to enter here.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'><i>Paphlagonia</i> is chiefly famous for the vast forests
that clothed the southern and more hilly portions of
its territory, and for its vast herds of horses, mules,
&amp;c. (the former of which are noticed so early as
Homer (Il. ii. 281 and 852)). Its only two towns of
any note were <span class='sc'>Amastris</span>, in the days of Pliny the
Younger a handsome place, with squares and many
public buildings,—and <span class='sc'>Sinope</span>; both towns, certainly,
of remote antiquity, the latter, indeed, attributed by
some to the Argonauts, and by others to the Amazons.
In the days of Xenophon, <span class='sc'>Sinope</span> was a rich and
flourishing city; and then, and for a long time, subsequently,
the navy of Sinope was highly distinguished
among those of the other maritime cities of Greece.
Sinope was also famous, like Byzantium, for the
fishery of the <i>pelamys</i> or tunny-fish; deriving, also, much
of its subsequent wealth from the fact, that it was
selected by the kings of Pontus as their royal residence.
Lucullus first, and Cæsar, subsequently, in
the wars with Mithradates and Pharnaces, respectively,
treated the people with much kindness, and left to
them most of the works of sculpture with which their
town had been embellished by the Pontic monarchs.
Sinope is mentioned as a flourishing place in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>times of Strabo, Trajan, and Arrian, nor did it decay,
till every other place, in like manner and for the same
reasons, decayed on the advent of the barbarians
from Central Asia, under the hoofs of whose horses,
as the proverb says, no grass ever grows again.</p>

<p class='c015'><i>Bithynia</i>, the last province of Asia Minor to which
we shall have to call attention, was, as we have
remarked before in the case of Mysia, in its population,
largely of Thracian origin. Subsequently to Cyrus
the younger, it was ruled by a series of native kings,
the last of whom, Nicomedes II., bequeathed his
country to the Romans. Many of these rulers were
men of tried valour; thus one defeated a general of
Alexander the Great; and another crushed the invading
Gauls. Pliny the Younger, in his letters, gives
an interesting account of the spread of Christianity
in this province, at the same time showing that his
stern and hardy master, Trajan, was less inclined to
act severely against them than his literary and philosophic
lieutenant. The towns of Bithynia to which
we propose to call attention, are <span class='sc'>Prusa</span>, <span class='sc'>Nicæa</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Nicomedia</span>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Prusa</span>, generally distinguished by the epithet <i>ad
Olympum</i>, more clearly to mark its site, is said to have
been built by Hannibal (Plin. v. 2), but was, probably,
much older, though Chrysostom, a native of the town,
does not claim for it any high antiquity (Orat. xliii.
p. 585). It continued to flourish under the Roman
Empire (Plin. Epist. x. 35), and was, also, for a while,
a leading place under the Greek Empire; indeed, it is
still, under the modified name of Broussa, one of the
chief cities of Turkish Anatolia. Its name will, doubtless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>be fresh in the memory of many of our readers as
the long home of the gallant Abd-el-Kader, and of
more than one of the Hungarian leaders whom the
treachery of Georgey compelled to abandon their native
country. The grand Olympus which overhangs
Broussa was generally termed the Mysian, to distinguish
it from the Olympus of Thessaly. Near it was
the town of Hadriani (now Edrenos), the coins of
which bear the inscription ΑΔΡΙΑΝΕΩΝ ΠΡΟC
ΟΛΥΜΠΙΟΝ.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Nicæa</span>, so named after his wife by Lysimachus, was
the real capital of Bithynia, and, for a long time,
one of the most important towns of Western Asia.
Pliny the Younger, as governor of the province, undertook
to restore it, and, during the later Byzantine
period it was constantly taken and retaken by the
Greeks and Turks, respectively. Leake and other
travellers show that there are abundant remains of
this famous old town, now called Isnik; not that, under
the Turks, it is, or ever could have become, a great
city. In Ecclesiastical story, Nicæa will ever be memorable
as the site where assembled, in A.D. 325,
the grand body of bishops, so well known as the
<i>Council of Nice</i>, to condemn the Arian heresy. Our
own Church is believed to owe to it its most valuable
“Nicene” Creed. Coins of Nicæa abound even
as late as the time of Gallienus.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Nicomedeia</span>, as the name implies, the chief residence
of the Bithynian kings of the name of Nicomedes,
was a large and flourishing city, and, as may be
gathered from the letters of Pliny to Trajan, long continued
so; indeed, in later times, when occupied with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>the Parthian or other Eastern wars, it was a convenient
and constant residence for the Roman emperors
(Niceph. Callist. vii.). We have a curious account of
the ruin done to this city by an earthquake in one
of the strange orations of Julian’s friend, the orator
Libanius, entitled μονωδία ἐπὶ Νικομηδείᾳ, in which he
mourns the loss of its public baths, temples, gymnasia,
&amp;c.: some of these were, however, subsequently
restored by Justinian (Procop. Ædif. v. 1). The historian
Arrian was born here, and Constantine the
Great died at his villa Ancyron, hard by.</p>

<p class='c015'>Having said so much on the subject of the leading
Greek cities of Asia Minor, or rather of some of
them, we shall notice, but as briefly as possible, the
principal islands adjacent to its shores; and as the
space at our disposal compels us to contract our
narrative within the closest limits, we shall refer only
to <i>Lesbos</i>, <i>Samos</i>, <i>Chios</i>, <i>Rhodus</i>, and <i>Cyprus</i>. <i>Crete</i>,
as a matter of fact, is generally attached, geographically,
to the continent of Greece, but, in any case,
would require a volume to itself that adequate justice
should be done to its ancient and modern story.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Lesbos</span>, which lay off the coast of Mysia, indeed,
about seven miles from Assos, was celebrated in ancient
times for its high cultivation of poetry and music, and
for the many men of literary eminence it produced.
To Lesbos we owe Terpander and Arion of Methymna,
Alcæus, and Sappho; and Pittacus, Theophrastus,
and Cratippus were also born there. More than one
passage in Homer, and especially Il. xx. 544, and
Odyss. iv. 342, show that many of the towns in the
island had large populations, even in remote times,
and owned, also, a considerable extent of territory on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the mainland opposite. Lesbos displayed a personal
love for freedom, which contrasted well with their
kinsmen on the continent; for, though crushed, for a
while, by Polycrates of Samos, and submitting, perhaps,
wisely, to Harpagus, the general of Cyrus, the
Lesbians were among the most active seconders of the
revolt of Aristagoras, suffering severely in the end, as
did Chios and Tenedos, when the Persians won the day.
So, too, at Salamis, they stoutly supported the Greek
cause. Their subsequent history was that of most of
the islands in the Ægæan. Sometimes they were for,
perhaps more often against, Athens; paying often
dearly enough for their love of freedom; and being,
in the end, chiefly under Athens, which, while strenuously
advocating the so-called sacred cause of freedom,
took good care to divide their lands among her own
citizens. In later days, they struggled against Roman
aggrandisement, but, of course, in vain. The Romans,
however, do not seem to have treated the island
with severity, and, as late as Commodus, we have
a coin reading ΚΟΙΝΟΝ Λεσβίων, which implies some
amount of self-government. We may mention, incidentally,
that, at Lesbos, Julius Cæsar received a civic
crown for saving the life of a soldier (Livy, Epit. 87;
Sueton. c. 2); that, in A.D. 802, Irene, the Byzantine
empress, here ended her strange life; and, that four
centuries later, John Palæologus gave Lesbos, as her
dowry, to his sister, when about to marry Francis
Gateluzio, in whose hands the island remained till
overwhelmed by the Turks.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Samos</span>, a name said to mean highland, and, doubtless,
deserving this name for its far superior height to
the islands adjacent, bore, like Lesbos, many different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>names in antiquity, with a population much intermixed,
the result of successive colonies of Carians, Leleges,
and Ionians. To the last people it chiefly owed
its historic fame, having been, in very early times, an
active member of the Ionian confederacy. As islanders,
the Samians had much credit for their skill in boatbuilding;
indeed, Thucydides (i. 13) goes so far as to
say they were the first boatbuilders, a statement, evidently,
to be accepted with a good deal of allowance.
It seems, however, certain that a citizen of Samos, one
Cælius, was the first to reach the Atlantic by passing
through the Pillars of Hercules, and that Polycrates,
the friend of Anacreon, did much to increase the naval
fame of his island.</p>

<p class='c015'>After having made treaties with Amasis of Egypt,
and Cambyses of Persia (which alone show the eminence
ascribed to Samos at this early period), we
know further, that, from Samos, as his head-quarters,
Datis sailed for Marathon, the inference being that
Samos at that time was less Greek than perhaps, it
ought to have been; hence too, perhaps, somewhat
later, the severe punishment inflicted on it by Pericles
and Sophocles. From the commencement of the
Roman wars in the East, Samos seems, generally, to
have sided with Rome, becoming, ultimately, part of
the province of “Asia.” Hence, too, probably the
fact that Augustus (or rather as he then was, Octavianus)
spent his winter there after the battle of Actium.
Samos was, in early times, greatly devoted to the
worship of Juno, and Herodotus states that her temple
there was the largest he had seen. It was, however,
never completely finished. According to Virgil, Samos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>was the second in the affections of Juno, and, in
Strabo’s time, in spite of the plunder it had suffered
in the Mithradatic war, and, subsequently, by Verres,
her temple was a complete picture-gallery. Here too,
as so often elsewhere, a Sacred Way led from the
temple to the city. Samos was also famous for an
earthenware of a “red lustrous” character. Her art, in
this respect, was copied by the Romans, their common
red ware being popularly called “Samian.” Of this
most Museums have abundant and excellent specimens
(Marryat, “Pottery and Porcelain,” 1850).</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Chios</span>, now <i>Scio</i>, in ancient days known by the
name Pityusa, referring doubtless to its abundant pine-forests,
was nearly as close to the mainland of Asia
Minor as Lesbos, and, in size, rather more than twice
that of the Isle of Wight. It was in character peculiarly
rugged, its epithet in Homer [of whom it claimed
to be the birthplace], of παιπαλοέσσα (the “craggy”),
being literally true. In ancient and in modern times
it has been famed for the beauty of its women; in the
former, also, for the excellence of its wines. In an
oval place, not far from its chief town, stood the temple
of Cybele, whose worship the Chiotes especially affected;
and, that all things might fit properly, the careless
Pococke seeing there her headless statue, which he
describes as that of Homer, with equal judgment converted
the lions between which she is sitting into Muses!
Its present chief town is said, in situation, to resemble
Genoa in miniature. Traditionally, its oldest people
were the Pelasgi; but Ion, a native writer, with better
reason, traces them to Crete. Chios was little injured
by the first Persian conquest, as the Persians, then like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Timúr, eighteen hundred years later, had no fleet; but
it was thoroughly sacked and plundered, subsequently,
for the crime of having sent one hundred ships to fight
off Miletus in aid of the Ionians (Herod. vi. 8, 32).</p>

<p class='c015'>During the Peloponnesian war, Chios at first supported
the Athenians, but was afterwards ravaged
by them, though they failed to take its capital.
So, in the Mithradatic war, though at first supporting
the king of Pontus, Chios fell under his displeasure,
in that it had allowed Roman “negotiatores” to frequent
and settle in its ports, and had to pay 2,000
talents, and to suffer still rougher treatment at the
hands of his general, Zenobius. In modern times, Scio
has suffered more perhaps than any other Greek island.
Early in the fourteenth century, the Turks secured
possession of it by a general massacre; in 1346, it was
taken from them by the Genoese, who held it for nearly
two centuries and a half, till it was recaptured by the
Turks. In 1822, having been foolishly over-persuaded—though
then a comparatively flourishing island—to
join in the revolt of the Greeks against the Turks, a
powerful Ottoman fleet attacked it, who, landing, massacred
right and left, enslaved its women and children,
and made, as is their wont, a well-cultivated district a
desert, destroying, too, by fire and sword a town with
thirty thousand inhabitants. No doubt fifty-four years
is a very long time in the eyes of mere politicians;
but historians might have been expected to remember
“Scio,” and to have anticipated similar results at
“Batak,” or wherever else these barbarians are able
to repeat the habits and practices of their fore-fathers.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span><span class='sc'>Rhodus</span>, an island about ten miles from the south-west
end of Lycia, next claims our attention, as one
of the most important of the Greek settlements of antiquity,
and as retaining still something of its ancient
splendour. In remote ages as the adopted abode
of the Telchines, a celebrated brotherhood of artists,
probably of Phœnician origin, Rhodes soon became
famous for its cultivation of the arts, so imported, leading,
as these did, naturally, to a civilization much
in advance of the people around them. Its early
history abounds with many legendary tales, which we
regret we cannot insert here (but see Pindar Ol. vii.;
Hom. Il. ii. 653). The Rhodians, no doubt from their
early connections with the Phœnicians, were among the
greatest navigators of antiquity, and this, too, earlier
than B.C. 776, when the Olympian games are said to
have been instituted: hence the foundation by them
of very remote colonies in Sicily, Italy, and Spain; in
the latter country, especially <i>Rosas</i>, which, remarkably
enough, retains its ancient name, but slightly modified.
The Rhodian code of naval laws became too, as is
well known, not only the law of the Mediterranean,
but the basis of the law of much more modern times.
The people of this island did not, perhaps, for prudential
reasons, join in the Ionian revolt or in the
Persian war.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the Peloponnesian war, too, they did not take an
active part, though serving (according to Thucydides),
with reluctance, on the side of Athens, against the
people of Syracuse and Gela. In those days they
were chiefly valued as light troops, especially, as darters
and slingers. In the cause of Darius Codomannus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>against Alexander, the Rhodians supported Memnon,
the ablest admiral of the day, whose death, perhaps
more than that of any other individual person, hastened
the downfall of the Persian monarchy; and
somewhat subsequently, their resistance to Demetrius
Poliorcetes, in the memorable siege they underwent,
secured them the highest credit, and the admiration
of their conqueror. Indeed, they were in such esteem
among their neighbours, that (so Polybius states) when
their city had been almost destroyed by an earthquake,
the rulers of Sicily, Asia Minor, Syria, and
Egypt vied with each other in the liberality of the
supplies and presents they sent to repair this calamity.
To the Romans their services were of the highest
value, indeed, it was mainly due to them, that the
naval operations of Livius, the Roman admiral, were
successful in the wars against Philip and Antiochus
(Liv. xxxi. 14; xxxvii. 9, &amp;c.).</p>

<p class='c015'>But, perhaps, the most interesting matter in connection
with the island of Rhodes is the history of the
researches recently conducted there by Messrs. Biliotti
and Salzmann on the site of Camirus, one of the three
chief original cities of that island, the combining of
which together, about B.C. 408, resulted in the creation
of the capital city, Rhodes. It was natural, therefore,
to expect that any antiquities discovered at these
places would be earlier than this date. The ground all
round is now covered by a pine forest, in the clearing
of which the old necropolis was discovered by a
bullock falling into a tomb. In 1853, Mr. Newton
obtained many <i>terra-cotta</i> vases of a very archaic
type, and other fictile vases from the peasants’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>houses of the adjacent village of Kalaverda. Some
of the <i>pinakes</i> or platters, with geometrical patterns
painted in brown on a pale ground, resembled the
oldest objects of this class from the tombs of Athens
and Melos; the sites, too, of Mycenæ and Tiryns
are also strewn with similar fragments.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c016'><sup>[112]</sup></a> Other amphoræ
and oinochoæ, with black figures on a red
ground, or red figures on a black, were also met with.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c016'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f112'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r112'>112</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As has been well shown in Dr. Schliemann’s recent researches.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Shortly after this, a <i>firman</i> was obtained from Constantinople,
empowering Messrs. Biliotti and Salzmann
to make a thorough investigation into this ancient
site, the result of which has been the opening of at
least 275 tombs. From these tombs many precious
works of art in gold, bronze, and glass, with figures in
terra-cotta, and calcareous stones, together with vases
and alabaster jars, have been procured, some of them
probably as old as B.C. 650. The whole may be
grouped under the heads: (1) Asiatico-Phœnician,
or Archaic Greek; (2) Greek of the best and latest
periods; (3) Egyptian, or imitations of Egyptian.
The first is the most important, as comprehending
most of the gold and silver ornaments, with a few
terra-cottas. It has been supposed that the makers
of these objects were Phœnicians of Tyre and Sidon;
but, as many of the specimens betray a marked
Assyrian character and influence, they are more
probably copies, at second hand, of works originally
Assyrian.</p>

<p class='c015'>On examining these curious works of art, it will be
observed that most of those in gold have been used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>either as necklaces or for attachment to other substances,
probably leather, consisting, as they do, for
the most part, of thin pieces or plaques of metal,
averaging from one to two and a half inches in
length, with subjects on them worked up, as a rule,
from behind, after the fashion now called <i>repoussée</i>
work. Thus we meet with standing female figures,
draped to the feet (which are close together), as
on the sculptures from Branchidæ, with long and
elaborately-dressed hair falling on their shoulders and
naked breasts, the arms being raised in a stiff and
formal manner, and the hands partially closed. Another
figure has large wings, almost like a <i>nimbus</i>,
hands crossed, and elbows square; and against the
body of this figure, a rudely-executed animal. A third
holds in each hand a small lion by the tail, just as on
some of the sculptures from Khorsabad. On a fourth
the lions are not held, but are springing up against
the figure.</p>

<p class='c015'>On another plaque we have nearly the same type,
with this distinction, that the lions stand out in very
high relief, and, curiously enough, are in style almost
identical with those on a <i>fibula</i> obtained from Cervetri
by the late Mr. Blayds. Many instances may be seen
of the <i>narsingh</i>, or man-lion type—a compound figure,
with the head, body, and legs of a man, but attached
to or behind this body, and, as it were, growing out of
it, the body of an animal with hoofs. This monstrous
form occurs, also, on a vase from Athens and on Assyrian
cylinders. There are, also, specimens of winged,
man-headed lions, their wings being thrown back so
as to cover the whole figure, just as on the Assyrian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>sculptures. In some cases, we find bronze plated with
gold, the latter having often been forced asunder by
the rust and consequent expansion of the bronze.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides these objects, were found, also, small glass
vessels of a rich purple colour with yellow bands, like
those from Cære and other of the oldest cities of
Italy, and a coffin, 6 feet 4 inches long, and 2 feet
1 inch wide, made entirely of <i>terra-cotta</i>. There are
traces of brown and red paint over the whole of it,
and, at one end, lions in red, with floral ornaments,
and, at the other, a black bull between two brown
lions. Many large terra-cotta plates were also found,
with various subjects; such as the combat between
Hector and Menelaus over the body of Euphorbus,
with the names of the combatants written over them,
a drawing of especial interest, from the archaic type
of the superinscribed characters: there were, too,
a Gorgon’s head, sirens, and other strange animals,
and a sphinx and a bull with his horns drawn in
perspective. These plates were probably of local
manufacture. But, besides these curious antique
monuments, the excavations at Camirus brought
to light many objects of very fine work, two of which
must be mentioned. One, a small gold vessel of
exceeding beauty, about an inch in diameter, at one
end of which is a seated Eros or Cupid; on the
other, Thetis on a dolphin, with the arrows Vulcan
had forged for her son Achilles. The other, a magnificent
amphora, with figures in red on a black ground,
the subject being “the surprise of Thetis by Peleus”;
in fact, the same as that on one side of the Portland
vase; thus confirming, in a most unexpected manner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the interpretation originally proposed many years ago
by Mr. Millingen. This vase is of the time of Alexander
the Great, and few, if any vases have as yet
been found in the Archipelago exhibiting such free
and masterly drawing as this one from Camirus.</p>

<p class='c015'>The island of <span class='sc'>Cyprus</span>, which lay off the southern
coast of Asia Minor, was one of the most celebrated
of those generally called the Greek Islands, though
it had, probably, less claim to this designation, and
was more Oriental than any of the others. It was,
as was natural from its position, early settled by the
Phœnicians, Herodotus speaking of the inhabitants
as a very mixed race. It is not possible to determine
which of several of its towns was the most
ancient; but, in the early Jewish Scriptures, we read
of “ships of Chittim,” probably those of Citium, one
of its chief towns. In later days, Paphos, itself of
remote antiquity, became the capital of the island,
and the residence, as we learn from the Acts of the
Apostles, of the Roman proconsul. As the centre of
the worship of Venus, which is noticed so early as
Homer, as well as by many later writers, Paphos was
greatly visited by strangers, among whom Tacitus
mentions, particularly, the Emperor Titus, when on
his way to besiege Jerusalem (Hist. ii. 3-4). Her
symbol, or idol, was a purely Asiatic type, and consisted
merely of an upright, conical, and unsculptured
stone. The history of the island was a very
chequered one, and there were but comparatively
short intervals of time when it was really under its
own native rulers; more frequently it was held
by one or other of the continental empires near it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>which happened for the time to be the most powerful.
Thus it was, usually, in the hands of the Persians,
till the overthrow of that power by Alexander,
when it was secured by the Ptolemies, in
whose diadem it was the most precious jewel. In
the end it was, of course, seized by the Romans, becoming
first an Imperial province, and then, by the
arrangement of Augustus, directly under the Senate.
In later times, it was the seat of a bishopric, one of
the most famous of the bishops of Paphos being the
celebrated Epiphanius. During the Crusades, Richard
Cœur de Lion captured the island and gave it to Guy
de Lusignan, king of Jerusalem, whence the title of
kings of Cyprus and Jerusalem, adopted, till recent
times, by some of the monarchs of Western Europe.</p>

<p class='c015'>In recent times, the Island of Cyprus has proved
one of the most abundant sources of precious remains
of antiquity, excavated chiefly by Mr. R. H.
Lang and General Palma di Cesnola. The former
gentleman has published in the Numismatic Chronicle
(vol. xi. New Series, 1870), an account of the silver
coins, many of native Cypriote manufacture, he
lighted on while digging out an ancient temple at
Dali (Idalium), in 1869. The coins were found at
two several times, and, from the way in which some
of them adhered together, had probably been enclosed
in a bag, though no traces of it were detected.
Mr. Lang believed he could trace from them the
existence of the six or seven distinct kingdoms, which
we know, from other sources, once existed in this
island. The earliest of these coins are, perhaps, as
old as the middle of the sixth century B.C.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>The most important results of Mr. Lang’s excavations
in this temple are now in the British Museum,
and have been described by him in a paper read
before the Royal Society of Literature (see Transactions,
New Series, vol. xi. pt. i. 1875). In this
memoir, which has been supplemented with some
careful observations by Mr. R. S. Poole, Mr. Lang
has given many interesting details of his excavations.
His first diggings were in 1868, when his men soon
“came upon (as it were) a mine of statues,” several
of them being of colossal proportions, and on two large
troughs, in an outer court, perhaps once employed for
the ablutions connected with the temple, which was
completely “full of the heads of small statues, which,
after being broken from their bodies, had been
pitched pell-mell into the troughs.” Near these troughs
were three rows of statues; some, too, of the chambers
excavated were also full of statuary—and in a
stratum of charcoal were comminuted fragments of
the bones and teeth of several animals; as of bullocks,
sheep, camels, and swine. We can only add, here,
that the treatment of the beard on some of the heads
is remarkably Assyrian; which, indeed, might reasonably
have been expected, as the island was long
subject to that empire,—and, that, besides coins and
sculptures, Mr. Lang procured, also, several Phœnician
inscriptions, not, however, of very early date,
their characters being nearly identical with those on
the well-known inscription in the Bodleian Library
at Oxford, together with one bilingual inscription in
Cypriote and Phœnician writing. The last has proved
of great value, in that it enabled the late Dr. Brandis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>and Mr. G. Smith to settle many important points
in connection with the Cyprian alphabet.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nearly about the same time as Mr. Lang, General
di Cesnola, the American consul in Cyprus, was
commencing a series of excavations, the latest results
of which have, in some respects, far surpassed anything
Mr. Lang achieved. M. Cesnola began digging,
we believe, first about 1867; but his first
important discoveries were in the spring of 1870,
when he found at Golgos the remains of two temples
of Venus, nearly on the spot where, some time before,
the Count de Vogüé had been less fortunate. It was
here that M. di Cesnola formed his first collection,
now for the most part in the museum of New York.
As in the case of Mr. Lang, the statues had all
been thrown down and grievously defaced by “iconoclastic”
hands. Among them, however, were many
which had been simply hurled from their pedestals,
and were, therefore, nearly as fresh as when first made.
One great interest in the collection is, that it is
almost wholly the product of local artists. Naturally
there was in it a large number of statuettes of Venus,
of vases, of lamps, and of objects in glass; the latter,
we believe, chiefly from Idalium. It is said that
altogether there were nearly 10,000 objects, and that
New York secured them for about £1 apiece. We
cannot discuss here the question, much mooted at the
time, whether or not the collection ought to have been
bought by the English Government; but, had it been,
we do not know where it could have been adequately
exhibited. The British Museum seems to be as full
as ever; nor is there any apparent hope of the removal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>of the hideous black sheds between the
columns in the front of it, which have now, for these
twenty years, defaced any architectural beauty it may
be supposed to have.</p>

<p class='c015'>But by far the most remarkable of General di Cesnola’s
discoveries are his most recent ones, the great
results of which are now, we believe, on their way to
New York, the American Government having had the
good sense to supply him with ample means for continuing
his researches in the best manner. These
last, commenced in 1873, have been prosecuted at
various ancient sites, such as those of Golgos, Salamis,
Palæo-Paphos, Soli, and Amathus; Curium
having ultimately proved the most valuable mine
of antiquities. Besides two superb sarcophagi he
had previously secured, M. Cesnola found at Curium
a mosaic pavement, in style, as he calls it, Assyrio-Egyptian,
which had already been partly dug through
by some former excavator, and beneath this, at a
depth of twenty feet, a subterranean passage in
the rock leading into three chambers, communicating
the one with the other. In the first of these
he came upon a great number of small ornaments,
rings, &amp;c., in pure gold; in the second, on a considerable
collection of gilt vases, cups, &amp;c.; and
in the third, on innumerable miscellaneous objects,
comprising vases of alabaster, candelabra, metal
mirrors, daggers, armlets, small statues of animals,
&amp;c. The most valuable individual specimens would
seem to be a crystal vase and a pair of armillæ in
gold, bearing a double Cypriote inscription. What
then is the history of this precious <i>trouvaille</i>? We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>venture to think that General di Cesnola’s idea on the
subject is probably the true one,—that it represents
the offerings in a temple now destroyed, and hurriedly
packed away, possibly when it was attacked by
iconoclasts. Some of the bijoux are inscribed with
the names of the owners, and probably donors. Like
the relics from Cameirus, these Cypriote monuments
are of great antiquarian value, as proving the transition
from Eastern to Greek art.</p>

</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>During</span> previous parts of this work we have, from
time to time, alluded to the presence of St. Paul at
various places we have described; the interest, however,
every one feels in the great Apostle of the
Gentiles induces us to throw together in one chapter
a brief summary of his journeys in Asia Minor; the
more so, that to a Christian, studying the history of
this portion of Western Asia, St. Paul stands out
alone—“none but himself can be his parallel.”</p>
<p class='c015'>St. Paul’s missionary labours commenced from the
period when the Holy Ghost said, “Separate me
Barnabas and Paul for the work whereunto I have
called them” (Acts xiii. 2); an order, doubtless, given
at Antioch in Syria, as they soon after started from
Seleucia, the port of Antioch, for Cyprus, the native
home of Barnabas. Antioch was then the capital of
Northern Syria, and as much, if not more than Jerusalem,
the centre of Christian evangelization. Hence,
the natural reason why at Antioch men were “first
called Christians.” Seleucia, too, at the mouth of
the Orontes, about twenty miles below Antioch, was
the “key of Syria,” and had, recently, obtained
from Pompey the title of a “Free City,” an honour
which it long retained. Dr. Yates (long a resident
in the neighbourhood), in an interesting memoir on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>this city (in the Museum of Classical Antiquities),
mentions that the names of the piers at the mouth of
its harbour still preserve a record of St. Paul’s voyage,
the southern one being called after him, and the
northern after Barnabas. Structures so vast as these
may easily have remained to the present day, for
Pococke states that some of the stones “are twenty
feet long by five deep and six wide, and fastened
together by iron cramps.” The voyage from Seleucia
to Cyprus is, generally, short and easy.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first place they made in the island was Salamis,<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c016'><sup>[114]</sup></a>
whence they proceeded right across it to Paphos,
the residence of the Roman governor, Sergius Paulus,
“a prudent man.” Here we have the remarkable
story of Elymas the sorcerer, and of the conversion
of the governor on witnessing the miracle by the hand
of St. Paul. Cyprus was at that time, as may be
gathered from Dio Cassius, under the direct government
of the Emperor of Rome, together with Syria
and Cilicia; but, a little later, this historian adds that
Augustus restored it to the Senate. St. Luke’s title,
therefore, of proconsul is correct, as that invariably
given to the rulers of the provinces belonging to the
Senate. A Cyprian inscription in Boeckh confirms
this view. The occurrence of a person called a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“sorcerer” at the court of the Roman governor is
quite in accordance with the manners of the times.
Thus, Juvenal sarcastically speaks of the “Orontes
flowing into the Tiber.”<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c016'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f114'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r114'>114</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Salamis was on the east side of the island, nearly opposite
to Syria; and, in early times, the capital of the island. It was
destroyed by the Romans, but rebuilt with the name of Constantia.
It was a little to the north of Famagousta, the name
of which, curiously enough, is not of Latin origin, as might be
supposed, but a lineal descendant of the original Assyrian Ammochosta.</p>

Jewish impostors of the lowest kind with whom Rome was then
infested: Juvenal, vi. 553, indicates the influence the so-called
Chaldean astrologers possessed there.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>It has been often thought that, from the miracle
over Elymas, dates the change of the name of the
apostle from Saul to Paul, and certain it is that,
subsequently to the words “Then Saul (who is
also called Paul)” (Acts xiii. 9), the first name
does not occur again; moreover, in his fourteen
Epistles the apostle invariably calls himself Paul. So
happened it in earlier days, when Abram was changed
into Abraham. It has been further supposed that, as
Barnabas was a native of Cyprus, the apostles were
induced to visit that island first; but, for their crossing
to Attalia in Pamphylia, in preference to any other
port, no reason can be assigned, though we may conjecture
that they acted on information obtained in
Cyprus. The communication was no doubt easy and
probably constant. Attalia, as we have pointed out,
was then, as now, a place of some consequence, and
almost the only port of southern Asia Minor: thence
they proceeded up the steep and rugged defiles of
the Pamphylian mountains to Perga, and, ultimately,
to Antiochia in Pisidia. The sacred writer records
no event on their route thither, except the secession of
Mark, which probably took place soon after they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>landed; nor has he even given the reason that influenced
Mark; but this may have been as Matthew
Henry has suggested: “Either he (Mark) did not
like the work, or he wanted to go and see his
mother.” St. Paul, we know, felt acutely, what he
might fairly have considered as little short of a desertion;
indeed, this secession led, as we shall see
hereafter, to the separation between himself and
Barnabas on the eve of his second missionary journey.</p>

<p class='c015'>Whatever Mark’s reasons, certain it is he did depart,
and that St. Paul pushed on with characteristic
bravery through a country the nature of which we
have described when speaking of Cremna, Sagalassus,
and of the probable position of Perge; and
which may be comprehended, in all its fulness, by
those who have time to study the valuable researches
of Leake and Hamilton, Spratt and Forbes,
Arundell and Sir Charles Fellows. It has been
reasonably conjectured that, St. Paul travelling, as he
probably did a little before the full heat of the
summer had commenced, attached his small party to
some large group or caravan travelling inwards and
northwards in the same direction. Many travellers,
and especially Sir Charles Fellows, have pointed out
the annual custom prevailing among the dwellers
along the southern shores of Asia Minor, of leaving
their homes at the beginning of the hot weather, and
of migrating with their cattle and household property
to the cooler valleys of the mountains.</p>

<p class='c015'>With regard to Antioch in Pisidia, we have already
shown that Mr. Arundell was the first to point out
that some ruins, now called Yalobatch, can scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>be any other than those of this Antioch. We need
not, therefore, dwell any longer on this point, simply
adding, that, from its great commercial importance,
St. Paul must have found there many resident Jews,
while we know that there was at least one synagogue.</p>

<p class='c015'>On arriving at Antioch, the narrative in the Bible
goes on to say that the Apostles “went into the
synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and sat down”; then,
after the reading the Law, as was and still is, the usual
custom, the rulers of the synagogue desired them to
speak, and St. Paul gave one of his most characteristic
addresses, being, at first, well received by his
own countrymen, and, especially so, by those persons
who, having given up idol-worship, were usually
known as proselytes. He was, therefore, invited to
preach on the following Sabbath-day, the intervening
week having been, no doubt, well employed in constant
meetings between St. Paul and these proselytes,
and in earnest addresses and exhortations. Hence,
we are told that, on this second occasion, “came
almost the whole city together to hear the word of
God.” But this was more than the Jews could endure:
so they stirred up the “chief men of the city,”
and the Apostles were soon after (we are not told
how soon) “expelled out of their coasts,” that is,
ordered to go beyond the limits of the Roman colony
of Antioch; though, as they returned to it again,
shortly afterwards, it is likely that no formal decree
of banishment was promulgated against them. On
this “they shook off the dust of their feet against
them.”<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c016'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f116'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r116'>116</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The action used by the Apostles was, it will be remembered,
in obedience to the direct words of our Lord: “Whosoever,”
said He, “shall not receive you nor hear you, when ye depart
thence, shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against
them” (Matt. x. 14; Mark vi. 11; Luke ix. 5). It was, in fact,
a symbolical act, implying that the city was regarded as profane.
It may be presumed that the “devout and honourable women”
(Acts xiii. 50) were proselytes.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>St. Paul’s speech, on the second Sabbath, is worthy
of note as that in which he first definitely stated the
object of his mission; for, when thus attacked by his
own countrymen, he turned upon them with the words,
“It was necessary that the word of God should first
have been spoken to you; but, seeing ye put it from you
and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, we
turn to the Gentiles” (Acts xiii. 46). Strabo (vii. 3)
has pointed out that “feminine influence” was a remarkable
characteristic of the manners of Western Asia
in his day, and of this we find the Jews availing themselves,
on this occasion. Leaving Antioch, then,
the Apostles turned nearly south-east to Iconium,
which, as we have already stated, was, in those days,
the chief town of the sub-district of Lycaonia. The
treatment the Apostles received at Iconium was not very
different from that they had experienced at Antioch.
Here, as there, “the unbelieving Jews stirred up the
Gentiles,” but were not, for some time, successful in
their designs, as the Apostles were able to abide there
a long time, “speaking boldly in the Lord.” In fact,
as at Ephesus, “the multitude of the city was divided,
and part held with the Jews, and part with the
Apostles” (xiv. 4). In the end, however, the Jews
prevailed: so the Apostles had to save themselves
from being stoned, by flight “unto Lystra and Derbe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth
round about” (ver. 6), “and there,” it is added,
“they preached the Gospel.”</p>

<p class='c015'>We have, already, shown that there is some doubt
as to the position of these two towns, but that
Mr. Falkener has probably found Lystra on the side
of a mountain called Karadagh, at a place called by
the Turks Bin-bir-Kalessi, or, the Thousand Churches.
So, too, the site of Derbe has, certainly, not been
yet made out completely; but, from the similarity
of name, it may be at Divle, as suggested by
Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c015'>The narrative of what took place at Lystra is very
interesting. At first, we may presume that St. Paul
preached to any chance groups that collected around
him: after some time, however, he saw a poor cripple
“who had never walked,” and “perceiving that he
had faith to be healed,” at once cured him, saying to
him with a loud voice, “Stand upright on thy feet.”
Need we wonder that the astonishment of the people
vented itself in the natural exclamation that “the
gods had come to us in the likeness of men.” The
narrative implies the existence, before the walls of
the city, of a temple of Jupiter (Acts xiv. 13), some
traces of which may, perhaps, still remain, and, if
so, will serve, hereafter, for the identification of the
site. Messrs. Conybeare and Howson have pointed
out that the beautiful legend of the visit of Jupiter
and Mercury to the earth, in Ovid’s story of Baucis
and Philemon, belongs to this part of Asia Minor:
the people of Lystra would, therefore, have been prepared
to recognize in Barnabas and Paul the Jupiter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>and Mercury of their own fables. What was the
“speech of Lycaonia” we have no means of telling,
no undoubted words of this dialect having, so far as
we are aware, been preserved.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the Lycaonians, though, at first, so readily
convinced of the divinity of the Apostles, soon showed
themselves as fickle as the “foolish Galatians.” St.
Luke adding, “and there came thither certain Jews
from Antioch and Iconium and persuaded the people,
and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city,
supposing that he was dead,” so little lasting was the
impression produced, even by the cure of one born a
cripple. It is, doubtless, to this attack upon him that
St. Paul, subsequently, alludes in the words, “Once
was I stoned” (2 Cor. xi. 25). That he was not
killed, like St. Stephen, as Barnabas and his friends
feared and the Jews hoped, is a miracle in itself.
Any how, he recovered at once as “he rose up
and came into the city,” and departed next day “with
Barnabas to Derbe.” It was at Lystra that St. Paul
made the acquaintance of Timotheus (or Timothy)
his future constant and steadfast companion. With
Derbe ends all that has been recorded of St. Paul’s
First journey. On the return, however, of Paul and
Barnabas, we learn that they fearlessly visited again
all the places where they had previously preached,
“confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting
them to continue in the faith.” At the same time,
too, they ordained “elders in every church,” praying
with fasting, and commending “them to the Lord,
on whom they believed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The course of the Second missionary journey of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>St. Paul, most of which falls within the limits of this
volume, was probably determined on when the Council
of the Apostles at Jerusalem sent letters “unto
the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, in
Syria, and in Cilicia” (xv. 23): it was manifestly, also,
St. Paul’s own desire, for he says, “Let us go again
and visit our brethren in every city, where we have
announced the word of the Lord, and see how they
do.” It was, on the proposal of this second journey,
that the famous dispute took place between St. Paul
and Barnabas, the former refusing to take with him
Barnabas’s kinsman Mark, because he had turned
back before. For this journey (at Attalia), therefore,
“Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended
by the brethren unto the grace of God; and
he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming the
Churches” (ver. 40). We cannot discuss here the circumstances
of this quarrel between the two “servants
of the Lord,” but one good result from it was, clearly,
a far wider preaching of the Gospel than might
otherwise have occurred; as, by this separation, two
distinct streams of missionary labour were provided
instead of one; Barnabas taking the insular, while
St. Paul took the continental line.</p>

<p class='c015'>We do not know which way St. Paul went on leaving
Antioch, but it is most likely he passed into Cilicia
by the “Syrian Gates,” now called the pass of Beilan,
the character of which may be fully learnt from Mr.
Ainsworth and other travellers. For some unknown
reason, Sacred history does not give the name of a
single place visited during this confirmatory tour, till
the Apostles reached Derbe and Lystra; though we
may feel sure, especially as the “Gentiles of Cilicia”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>are mentioned in the letter of the Apostles, that St.
Paul did not fail to visit his native town, Tarsus, the
“no mean city” of his address to the Roman governor.
At Tarsus, if anywhere in Cilicia, Christians would be
surely found who would be glad of the Apostle’s
“confirming” words. From Tarsus, St. Paul must
have passed from S.E. to N.W., through the great
mountain barrier which separates the central table-land
of Asia Minor from the plain country in which Tarsus
was situated. There are several passes; the nearest
to Tarsus and most direct, being that of the “Cilician
Gates,” a remarkable cleft, about eighty miles
in length. Ascending, probably, by this pass, St. Paul
would reach the plains of Lycaonia, at an altitude of
about 4,000 feet above the sea, in four or five days.
At Lystra (probably) he met again the young disciple
Timotheus, “who was well reported of at Lystra
and Iconium,” and who, at St. Paul’s request, at
once joined him: thence, “as they went through
the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep
that were ordained by the Apostles and Elders that
were at Jerusalem; and so were the churches
established in the faith, and increased in number
daily.” We are not told that, on this occasion, St.
Paul met with any serious opposition.</p>

<p class='c015'>The brevity of the account of this journey is most
disappointing, as we do not know whether St. Paul
visited even Antioch in Pisidia: all we learn is that
he was <i>ordered</i> to “go through Phrygia and the region of
Galatia,” altogether new ground, and representing districts
that could not have been evangelized before. Yet
even here the names of no towns are recorded till he
gets to Mysia: on the other hand, he was <i>not permitted</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>to preach the “word” in Asia; that is, within Roman
“Asia,” nor to enter Bithynia. Most likely, as suggested
by Messrs. Conybeare and Howson, he followed
the great Roman lines of communication, and
passed by Laodicea, Philomelium, and Synnada.</p>

<p class='c015'>It has been inferred from his use of the plural, “to
the churches of Galatia,” as the heading of his Epistle
to that people, that there was no one great church
there, as at Ephesus or Corinth; but this seems to us
refining too much. We may, however, suppose that no
special miracles marked this journey, or, at all events,
none which St. Luke thought it necessary to notice.
We learn from St. Paul himself (Galat. iv. 13) that it
was owing to bodily sickness that he preached to the
Galatians in the first instance, it may be, as has been
suggested, on his way to Pontus, from which distant
province we know that some Jewish proselytes had
come to Jerusalem, and were present on the day of
Pentecost (Acts ii. 11): moreover, it is certain, from
his Epistle to the Galatians, that he had been well
received by this inconstant people, a large and mixed
multitude having embraced Christianity.</p>

<p class='c015'>As, in so many other instances, no clue is given us
as to the further route actually taken by the Apostles
to Troas, but, by the Divine prohibition to them of
preaching in “Asia,” we may conjecture that the time
was not ripe for spreading the Gospel among the great
cities of Ephesus, Smyrna, or Pergamus. It will be
noticed that the Apostles are not forbidden to <i>enter</i>
Asia, as was the case with Bithynia, but only not to
<i>preach there</i>. Indeed, they could not, easily, have got
to Troas without passing through “Asia.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The first seaport St. Paul reached must have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Adramyttium, which is not, however, noticed here by
name, though it is subsequently, when on the voyage
to Rome. Of this place we have, already, given some
account: and hence, it would seem, that the Apostle
passed onwards to Assos and Alexandria Troas, where
the remarkable vision appeared to him which is thus
described:—</p>

<p class='c015'>“And a vision appeared to Paul in the night.
There stood a man of Macedonia and prayed him,
saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
And, after he had seen the vision, immediately we
endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering
that the Lord had called us for to preach the
Gospel unto them. Therefore, loosing from Troas
we came with a straight course to Samothrace....”
(Acts xvi. 9, 10, 11).</p>

<p class='c015'>Compelled as we are here to compress as much
as possible what must be said, we reluctantly
desist from following St. Paul to Europe. We
need, therefore, only state that, after two years St.
Paul returned to Antioch in Syria and Jerusalem,
passing, on his way, sufficient time at Ephesus, so
that “he himself entered into the synagogue, and
reasoned with the Jews” (xviii. 19), promising, at the
request of the congregation, that he would return to
Ephesus, “if God will.” Having “saluted the
Church” (probably of Jerusalem) he returned to
Antioch, and thence “departed and went over all
the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening
all the disciples,”<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c016'><sup>[117]</sup></a> arriving, ultimately, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Ephesus, where he found Apollos, “an eloquent man,
and mighty in the Scriptures” (xviii. 24).</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f117'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r117'>117</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The brief statement in the Acts does not tell us anything of
the course St. Paul took on this occasion; but as he went “over
all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order,” we can have no
doubt that his visitation of the churches was complete, and that
he went to all or most of the places noticed in the previous
journeys.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The visit of St. Paul to Ephesus was the period
when it pleased God to do for the later disciples
what had been previously done, twelve or thirteen
years before, on the day of Pentecost: “the Holy
Ghost came on them, and they spake with tongues,
and prophesied.” In the present instance, it is
enough to refer to the words in the narrative as
given in the Acts xix. 2: “He” (St. Paul) “said unto
them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?
And they said unto him, We have not so
much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost,”
&amp;c.... “When they heard this, they were baptized
in the name of the Lord Jesus; and when Paul laid
his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them,
and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.”</p>

<p class='c015'>At Ephesus St. Paul dwelt more than two years,
diligently preaching the Gospel, and “disputing daily
in the school of one Tyrannus.” No opposition appears
to have arisen for some time; indeed, for three
months, he was allowed the use of even the synagogue;
but, in the end, the idol-brokers felt their trade was
in jeopardy, and, especially, men, who, like Demetrius,
the silversmith, making the “silver shrines for
Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As at Corinth, St. Paul at Ephesus was brought,
face to face, with Asiatic superstition, withstanding
even magic arts, as Moses did, Jannes, and Jambres,
and, also, “exorcists.” What this “magic” really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>was has been much debated. Anyhow, the Talmud
tells us that a “knowledge of magic” was required as
a necessary qualification for a seat in the Sanhedrin,
so that the councillor might be able to try those accused
of such practices, though some of these need
not, necessarily, have been of evil intention: it is
clear, however, from the case of Sceva (xix. 14), that
many of the “exorcists” made a bad use of any superior
knowledge they possessed or pretended to have.
St. Paul’s success, however, in putting down this
species of knavery, was so complete, that a large
number of the exorcists submitted to him, and burnt
their books, which were valued at a very high price.
The “town-clerk” was, doubtless, as we have remarked
before, a Roman officer, and, as the keeper
of the public records, one of the most important
personages in the town. His language in putting
down the <i>émeute</i> in the theatre clearly shows this;
but, as he evidently refers to others of greater power
than himself, we hardly think, as some have done, that
he was himself one of the “Asiarchs,” or, as our
translation has it, “chiefs of Asia.” His language
shows that he was not unfriendly to St. Paul (though
not necessarily that he was, himself, a Christian); and,
further, that he well knew how to deal with a multitude,
“the more part of whom knew not wherefore
they were come together.”</p>

<p class='c015'>We have now brought nearly to an end the short
outline we felt it necessary to give of St. Paul’s journeying
in Asia Minor. It is probable that, soon after
the disturbance in the theatre, he left for Macedonia;
so that the rest of his connection with Asia Minor
or with the Greek islands may be summed up in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>few words. After some time passed in Macedonia,
with a possible journey through Illyricum and Western
Greece, which occupied him for three months (xx. 3),
St. Paul returned to the north, and, passing by
Philippi and Neapolis, crossed the Ægæan to Alexandria
Troas. This second visit to Troas is chiefly
notable for the story of the boy Eutychus, who,
overcome with sleep when St. Paul continued his
speech until midnight, fell to the ground and was
killed. It will be observed, that, in the miracle of
his restoration to life, St. Paul implied the use of
the very words of our Saviour to the young maiden:
“She is not dead, but sleepeth.” Thence he proceeded
alone on foot twenty miles to Assos, through
a district then, as now, richly wooded, but with a good
Roman road, long since in utter decay. It was a
lonely walk the great Apostle pursued then; but solitude
is sometimes required to give greater strength.</p>

<p class='c015'>From Assos St. Paul took ship to Mytilene, proceeding
onwards to Chios, Samos, Trogyllium, and Miletus.
At this last place, he summoned the elders from Ephesus,
and bade a solemn farewell to the Christians of
Asia, among whom he had laboured so long and so
efficiently; and passing thence by Coos and Rhodes
to Patara, finally entered a ship there, and sailed to
Phœnicia (xxi. 1). At Trogyllium the Admiralty chart
shows a harbour that still bears the name of St. Paul’s
Port. So far as we know, with the exception of touching
at Cnidus on his last voyage to Rome, St. Paul
had no further connection with Asia Minor.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
